Can safely say that every hour I've sunk into this game was without regret, despite whatever publicized shortcomings. It also stars Keanu Reeves.",

It could have been the game of the decade, but I think it came close to GoY with the 1.5 patch.\nYes I know they missed a boatload of contents that was promised, but quite frankly I don\u2019t care nor should anyone who enjoys the great SP game.  What is also important is that CDPR has not given up on the game and there are future patches planned for the PC.\nThe story is great, the characters are amazingly well developed. Voice acting for female V is unparallel. I strongly recommend playing with fem V.\nCity is amazingly detailed and immersive.  \nGraphics is well optimized and even earlier cards can get some impressive visuals. \nHere is what\u2019s not working well:\n-\tLack of interaction with the city\n-\tBed driving model for vehicles \u2013 driving with keyboard in first person is atrocious. 3rd person is ok.\n-\tCombat Balance \u2013 you clearly notice it once you reach lvl 30 \u2013 almost no combat challenge.\n-\tUI, inventory management \u2013 very fundamental and hard to keep track\n-\t Just that feeling that something is missing in the game. I would say CDPR release the game with 70% of contents and it feel s that way too.\nMost above can be fixed with Mods. I highly recommend to check Nexus for latest. \nThis review is based on the 1.5 and 1.6 patch play.\n",

        "content": "I've actually played this for significantly longer than Steam reports as I also owned the game on GOG when it originally released, so I've gotten to experience the game from each of its various stages of development.\n\nFor all of its troubles and tribulations and shortcomings brought on by overzealous marketing and corporate mismanagement, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game I love tremendously. For what it lacks (as of this review) in the open world, it makes up for with a visually spectacular setting and a very engaging storyline. I also think the combat is an absolute blast, especially with the rebalancing and enhancing that's gone on over its patch history. \n\nThere's way more that can be done to make the game even better (my personal requests being overhauling the police, more side activities to do in the world like the arcade game and the interactables in the apartments, more apartment customization), a number of features promised in the marketing are still absent, and what happened with its launch should never be forgotten. \n\nThat said... most of the core problems that weren't to do with fundamental design decisions around the game have been addressed. What's here now is a really solid FPS / RPG in the vein of the modern fallouts (3, New Vegas, 4), but with vastly better gunplay. If you're looking for a new GTA / Red Dead Redemption type of world, this probably won't satisfy the itch as it stands.",

It's a shame that all these features that people have been wanting in the game (that were promised in the game day one) are only just now coming to the game. If nothing else, CDPR has at least shown they are willing to work hard to make up for their mistakes and mismanagement of this game. As of the time of this review, the game is mostly bug-free, and plays much more like an action-RPG than a linear FPS. CDPR has just stated they are bringing an overhauled police and vehicle combat system, as well as other updates to cyberpunk soon. The new expansion, \"Phantom Liberty\" looks great, and I'm excited about Keanu Reeves reprising his role as Johnny Silverhand. This was a pleasant surprise. in about 8 months time, this game won't be really good. It will be one of the best sci-fi games ever made.",

The game has started freezing for as yet unknown reasons at random times requiring a reset.\nI am trying to figure out what that is. \nThe event log shows a local application com server id error which is a  common windows flaw that microsoft has never properly addressed.\nThere  is a workaround for it.\nHowever I am not sure that is the cause of the freeze.\nThe fix is a nuisance to perform but I will do it and see if that fixes the freezes.\n \nDespite all the patches the game still has bugs. Patch 1.6 supposedly is coming out in a couple of days and that might fix the worst of those that remain.\nThe bugs I have seen are cars with their tires buried in the ground, people walking through obstacles. That kind of stuff.\nThe game is largely incomplete and it does not appear the expansion of which there will be only one will come anywhere near  finishing  it,\nThe developers promised a lot they failed to deliver.\nThe game is visually stunning. The quests are just ok  and not compelling imo.\n\nI would give it a 6 out of 10. Great visuals,  good fighting  on the positive side. On the bad side Meh story and quests. Game largely incomplete. No real good ending.",

I will admit that the choices you get to make are inferior to New Vegas, but the world is just as high concept and full of unforgettable characters and stories.

It depreciates the value of multiple playthroughs, regardless of just a different romance being in some endings",

I will be playing it more for sure, but honestly... 3/5?\n+Combat is fun, stealth & tech is very viable but melee is more fun and becomes op.\n-Most of the \"content\" IS forgettable fetch and kill quests.\n-Level-tiered gear, makes everything you have useless, regularly, as you progress.\n-Main quest / story / whatever has not been enjoyable thus far. Feel forced out of my character into the edgy punkish (and anticorporate) V the devs imagined, dialouge doesn't fit what I want to be, the bonus options from your background and skillset are rare, having no actual effect and basically you just do whatever the other npc says / wants because reason. Avoided it like the plauge out of disdain.\n-Traffic is suicidal in game. Motorcycle advised for getting around stupidity like the AI sitting at green lights for 4 cycles, then you're going around them and their AI updates and decides to finally move and ****ing crash into you, the audacity.\n-Crime system, may as well not exist. The only crimes you can do are harming civvies and straight up attacking the police. Walking about 100m away clears all crime status and there is no lasting bounty.\n-There is no faction rep system. Kill hundreds of gangsters, wipe out their leaders they still won't know who you are, try to retaliate, or even stop respawning on every street corner. Attack corporate convoys, patrols, installations whatever? They couldn't care less.\n-You can't interact with the world much, sit down on a bench, hack a vending machine for free soda or a traffic light to watch the chaos unfold, sit back and view things along the pier, help npcs you just rescued from gansters, most buildings are inaccessible and don't really exist; you're just a walking war machine waiting to get back into combat.\n-INT stat. Useless. I have absolutely no points in it, could still buy a big cpu stick it in my head and use all the advanced quickhacks like suicide, system reset, squad-wide memory resets, security deactivation, etc. If they required it for hacks instead of just having a good processor, or required you to have a higher int to equip a better processor, maybe.",

The dialog is 100% real cheese, the gunplay is subpar, and the world is a complete facade. Scripted events pull the player out of the \"zone\" due to how the NPC's reactive to the situation. The AI combat is just laughable; there is no way that anybody who has given this game a positive review hasn't in multiple instances laughed, or held back laughter, while in the middle of combat. It is just absurd! To test this out, just watch an AI teammate react while in combat mode. Cover? Nah, they'll just blaze straight in, unless they have targeted the enemy through a cement staircase at which point they will just aim at the ground and not move. Or maybe once an enemy has been fully alerted, go stand right next to them and listne to them talk to themselves. Or maybe dump five live grenades and watch a group of enemies run straight towards them. \n\nOther things I really enjoy - you are tasked with taking on a building full of enemies, what if half of those enemies use the exact same dialog? What if they continuously ask you to come outside when you are the one outside and they are indoors? It's fun watching an NPC play an arcade game while the game says insert coins. How about waitresses that will rotate to the same table over and over doing nothing. I liked how my AI teammate would disarm only to walk around in combat stance with no weapon. Or the scripted driving events where you are the passenger heading to a mission and the driver is hitting every obstacle in site. \n\nWell that's just off the top of my head. I've attempted to play this game three times now and just give up each time after 10-15 hours. \n\nAAA title that is just trash, doesn't stand up to what was promised and certainly doesn't stand up to anything near the quality of other big budget games. The fact that Assassins Creed has much better combat, AI interaction, flow, and general open-world believability is hard imagine but it's true, Look at something from Santa Monica Studios or Naughty Dog, and this is basically at about the level of Saints Row 2. \n\nHate to say it and I know the creators had a lot of passion but they bit off way more than they could chew. Time crunch, money crunch, and generally an uphill battle to get the game were it is at now. It must have been disheartening releasing this game knowing clearly all of it's faults. Clear as day but in way to deep to do anything about it. \n\n",

At max graphics (4k resolution) with Ultra ray tracing I was still getting 50+ fps I turned the resolution down to 2k and put the ray tracing on high and was getting 100+ fps in even the most dense areas.

So, to start, did CDPR mess up in the beginning and release a game that was simply not ready for prime time?  Indeed.  Do I feel like they've redeemed themselves with what the game has in it as of today?  Yes for sure.  Did they actually deliver on what they hoped to do and \"promised\"?  Not quite, but that is the reality of gaming industry.\nCyberpunk 2077 is definitely a step in the very right direction for the genre and for this type of open world gaming.  It has a great set of characters and fun game play for anyone who is coming to this game with fresh eyes.  Anyone expecting there to be new content thrown into the game like some others (Genshin I'm looking at you), then this isn't the game for you.  Its a story that you get to play, with little stories that take you into the lives of those around you in Night City along the way.  As all good stories go, there is a beginning a middle and yes, an end, and that's ok too.  I'm all for replaying a game, but don't think that you will have much wiggle room in those replays as its not that kind of game.  Should you play it?  Yeah, its a fun game.  Am I looking forward to a follow up game on a new game engine?  Oh yes.",

Weder zu nicht erf\u00fcllten Ank\u00fcndigungen oder \u00fcbersteigertem Hype etwas sagen m\u00fcssen, weil das schon zu gen\u00fcge vorhanden ist. Es geht mir wirklich und ausschlie\u00dflich um das Game an sich, ohne Politics oder Marketing.\n\nIch hatte Cyberpunk entgegen gefiebert wie viele andere auch. Doch habe ich mir nicht ein Video oder einen Post zur Entwicklung angesehen gehabt. Vielleicht gerade deshalb, bin ich mit dem Spiel so gl\u00fccklich. Das Kampfsystem ist herrlich ausf\u00fchrlich, variabel und wunderbar animiert. Crafting, Vehikel, Apartments, Soundtrack, Dialoge und Map sind alle mehr als nur zufriedenstellend. Die Welt von Cyberpunk lebt. Und gerade das haut mich jedes mal aus den Socken. Von Verkehr \u00fcber Passanten zu Stadtvierteln, alles ist in sich harmonisch und authentisch. Allein daf\u00fcr laufe oder fahre ich gerne durch Night City.\n\nNat\u00fcrlich gibt es Dinge die mich pers\u00f6nlich st\u00f6ren. Die Mainstory ist solala, fast alles an Story hat einen bitteren Beigeschmack und viele Dinge w\u00e4ren besser etwas mehr als nur angekratzt worden. Oftmals w\u00fcnsche ich mir dass ich mehr Freiheit h\u00e4tte, manchmal reagieren Charaktere v\u00f6llig unlogisch und so weiter.\nAber hier muss ich den Machern von 2077 etwas entgegenkommen. Denn sie haben trotz aller m\u00f6glichen Kritiken, immer zu ihren Entscheidungen gestanden. Dann haben die Romanzen eben geschlechtliche Bedingungen und dann sind die Enden eben so offen wie sie sind. Das gesamte Spiel ist in sich konsistent und damit vollkommen richtig, so wie es ist.\n\nZuletzt muss man dazu sagen, dass es noch immer dann und wann ein Update gibt, daher w\u00fcrde ich behaupten, dass f\u00fcr mancherlei Kritik zu Release gar kein Grund mehr besteht.\nCyberpunk 2077 ist eines der besten und lebendigsten Open-World-RPGs.",

        "content": "Firstly: I'm not a huge cyberpunk fan - the genre held only passing interest for me, but I was looking for something new to do and gave this a shot. I'm profoundly glad I did; the early press was so bad that my expectations were extraordinarily low. I have never been more wrong in my life, and that includes a stripper ex-girlfriend who slept around.  \n\nFor all the rough publicity - fair though it may have been - at launch, CP2077 has turned into a high-quality, multi-faceted CRPG with perhaps some of the best character writing and voice acting yet turned in by performers. I started singling out voice cast for their roles, but as I did so, I realized I'd be listing most of them. By far, CDPR managed to salvage gold from a disappointing launch, and it's on the strength of the performance by the voice actors and well-written, multi-faceted, human characters that really shine for me. \n\nThe graphics perform well on my mid-range system, running all at max but saving on ray-tracing. The controls are smooth enough, but there are mods - especially for driving - that make it even better. Frame rates are smooth, and transitions between areas are completely fluid and transparent. There are times - especially riding a motorcycle in the desert - that just feel so viscerally solid that you almost wish the road would go on for hours. \n\nThe story... is compelling, but for me, was slightly disappointing, if we're being honest. I would have loved to continue in Night City for an indefinite period of time; driving and listening to music really is that enjoyable. It would have been nice to see random events pop up after the canonical \"end\" of the story - but without spoiling it, it's logical enough that there aren't. \n\nPrepare yourself - if you've even a shred of empathy and compassion - for some heartbreak. There's genuine emotion and feeling in a lot of the actors' performances, and CDPR translated those exceptionally well to the digital actors. There are no games that I can think of off-hand where the character you're \"speaking\" to makes amazing eye contact with you. CDPR pulled that off here, and it's breathtaking in its effect.\n\nIf you're a fan of the genre and can appreciate a well-told, well-acted story, I really do think you ought to give this one a chance. If you're not - like me - and just looking for something to engage you enough to lose hours - you really can't go wrong here. Not now. CDPR has done well here, and I hope that you'll give this one a chance. \n\nNo regrets, choom. This one's nova, and well worth the eddys.",

It's a game of brutal violence, and genuinely tender character moments; of beauty and squalor; of complex moral choices and simple grinds. Like the Witcher games that form CDPR's other major franchise, there are few clear-cut moments where you can say, \"What I did here was definitely good, and will have no bad consequences for anyone who did not deserve them.\" The best you can hope for is that you learned something about your character, maybe about yourself in real life (corny as that may sound), along the way.\n\nThe biggest hint I'll give (although by now, this game has been talked about so much you hardly need hints from me) is this: make a point of actually befriending every romancable NPC, Even if you have no intention of **romancing** them, make friends with them. As far as I can tell, every quest for these NPCs is available even if you just befriend them, including some of those tender personal moments, that help you feel that, despite your character's plight, you're not alone!",

I can't comment on the console experience, but on a PC it runs great, looks incredible (even running on my rather old 1080Ti, I have everything set to at least High).\n\nThe story is intriguing, as one would expect from CD Projekt, and the city is truly immersive. I have almost 150 hours and if I've encountered the very rare bug, it was trivial, such as not being to pick up a random item. \n\nThe most unique and simultaneously greatest thing about Cyberpunk is the gameplay. It's awesome! Unlike other games I've played, you truly can approach every situation completely differently, and all of the variations are fun. \n\nI loved The Witcher and I love this game.",

The game doesn't have many options to play after main storyline expect gigs, side quests and that's it. The skills/skill trees are very impressive you can play this game in lots of ways. The stealth mechanic is very bad I've never been able to do something fully stealth and it's painful just do loud or if you have a netrunner build you can easily do stealth but it was never fun to me. The graphics are fantastic but the crowd ai just sucks. The cars are not gonna notice you and drive trough you (most of the times).\nIf you are looking for an SC-FI, FPS with average story this is the game for you! 8/10",

For a 2 year old $80 game, I would not recommend buying, since there are more polished, newer games at this price point and maybe after a couple more years they'll finally have these issues ironed out. If you really want to try it though, at least wait for a sale.\n\nUPDATE after playing the game for a while longer I've found my first game-breaking bug where it's impossible to progress - it's a well known bug online, search \"cinema door bug\" which has been around for years and isn't fixed. I cannot recommend buying this game until it's actually fully playable.",

The narrative is always at least serviceable and sometimes excellent. Gameplay is mostly fun, though the side gigs in particular do start to feel repetitive eventually. I've spent plenty of time in the game and am still discovering all sorts of hidden treasures. The larger narrative about the powers that be in Night City, which mostly doesn't impact gameplay, gets darker and more fascinating the deeper you go and provides plenty of fodder for (fingers crossed) future DLCs.\n\nThen there are the bugs, which aren't gamebreaking like they were for some on release but range from amusing (e.g. objects randomly flying into the air without being touched, cars buried in the pavement or driving along a few feet above the ground, NPCs standing in midair over roadways) to annoying (e.g. ambient light randomly gets so bright I can't see anything, especially after dark in remote areas). There are other things some players may find annoying, like the truly baffling vehicle physics, but I mostly find these quirks fun.\n\nIf you don't mind the bugs, this is a game well worth your time and money.",

        "content": "Came back to the game after doing a run on launch and I thought the game was great then.\nAfter coming back I gotta say I think it's great now and I can't wait for the DLC, The game has incredible feel, some of the best combat flow I've seen in almost any game, enough vastly different playstyles to suit anyone's need and a progression system that makes the way you play unique. Wonderful storytelling and on the hardest difficulty at least, a feel of going from the underdog, to a Night City legend, especially in the [spoiler] Secret Ending of becoming a one-man-army and king of the city and a cliff hanger that leaves me begging for more [/spoiler]",

What I got was only a bunch of them (that still need fixing) but otherwise, playable! \nA little disappointed by boss fights, even for a Normal difficulty they are too easy, but maybe I should try a harder one.\n\nGood: \n- Shooting enemies heads off is really joyful. \n- Characters are lovable. \n- Music is amazing!\n- Atmosphere is incredible!\n- Story is great although so many opportunities to improve in the future!\n\nNeeds improvement:\n- Driving! From what I see it became much better, judging by videos, but turning seems really weird, when you drive with NPCs, it feels like the car is weightless.\n- Vehicular damage.\n- Reaction of people around you to the shooting. I could shoot a car 300m away with a sniper rifle, and there was just no reaction at all.\n- Had a hard time initiating an interactions with some NPCs. Came right up to them and had to do some jumping and running around to finally see dialog options.  \n- Looting could be better, like Fallout f.e., where you see all the loot in radius in a single box.\n- The shadows are... well... see for yourself, they are really weird. The character shadow, I mean,\n",

        "content": "Matrix meets Blade Runner meets Fight Club meets Grand Theft Auto! The once long awaited role-playing SCI-FI action that set out to both capture and define the essence of cyberpunk at a whole new level is now (patch 1.5) practically impossible to disappoint. \n\nForget the early critical reviews, this game is nothing like Dec, 2020. Bring your curiosity, imagination, and plenty of free time to the table and this game will do the rest. Even on the mid range PC, this game shines without skipping a beat. But don\u2019t let the eye candy distract you for long. The action can be intense, the drama convincing, the characters uniquely developed, and story arc absolutely epic. Save often and be honest to your character. Entertain no spoilers as you enter. A heart of TL;DR can ruin this for you, so don\u2019t go there until you played through at least once.\n\nThere\u2019s no clock so feel free to take your time. Explore as much as you can and appreciate the nods and Easter eggs when you see them. Otherwise, the city does not spare you: You will be touched, you will be surprised, you will question your values, and you will take the job anyway. Do you proceed with mercy or vengeance? Sometimes you decide, sometimes you have little choice.\n\nIf you seen the trailers then you know he\u2019s here and in no small part. Whether antagonist or protagonist in your point of view, you can experience the many nuances of Silverhand/Ted/Neo/Wick in a memorable character befitting the genre Keanu Reeves help define. This is an interactive aspect of the story line, and I must leave it at that.\n\nBugs? Yes, plenty, still. Some are annoying, some hilarious, others you pray CDPR will never fix. None are deal breakers and that leaves plenty of immersion and detail for player to experience. If you were let down by the technical flops of an earlier release and left half-way then I encourage you to patch and start a new game. Don\u2019t leave sour and don\u2019t leave this hanging.\n\nEven years from now this game will be remembered as the bar raiser others will have to surpass.\n\n",

        "content": "I followed the hype but waited till 2022 to get this game. Whatever happened at launch seems to be fixed with patch 1.5, majority of the bugs are gone. There are still some but I've been able to fix these small bugs by reloading a saved game. For example one item was missing when I was rushing out from Arasaki tower, a keycard, that was needed for elevator. I saved and reloaded the game, then the item appeared and was able to progress forward. These need to be polished out but it did not break my game experience as I was able to progress forward after reloading. Another issue I've witnessed is the AI of other drivers on the streets of Night City, they seem really stupid sometimes.\n\nNow if we talk about the game as a game, this is mind blowing stuff. Night City is really gorgeous looking place, full of filth, gritty characters and all sorts of things to discover. The game looks really good, probably one of the best visuals in a game I've seen for a long time. I really hope that the DLC for this game comes out soon, feel like there is potential for more of side quests or things to do around the Night City and hope that the game producer delivers on this. Regardless of the minor bugs that are still there, this game appears to be worth the hype and certainly is a recommended experience.",

The devs really did their best to make the game more stable and playable. \n\nWith that aside, Night City is just so beautiful and alive. There's enough content for at least a couple of weeks or maybe longer if you're slow like me. The side quests alone are entertaining to play. I've only been playing the Street Kid life path for the past 20 hours of playtime, and each life path gives a different backstory. This means there's so much replayability (if that's even a word) in this game.\n\nOverall, I'm loving this game so far and I highly recommend anyone to pick this up if it goes on sale.",

        "content": "First and foremost, the game works like it should've at launch as far as functionality goes. Finally. \n\nBut the biggest issue I've found with it is that I just don't care, and it doesn't make me care. The city is full of NPCs, but feels empty. Interaction with most of them is limited to pushing a button once you manage to get absurdly close and trigger the prompt to hear a line or two of canned dialogue. The story is interesting but stilted, and though the devs clearly put a lot of effort into making the supporting characters pretty, it's all veneer. I didn't care about them like I cared about the herbalist and her attempt to save the griffon victim in the Witcher, or the room full of hostages in Human Revolution. I didn't find myself interested in seeing what happened after I made decisions. Things, including people, are just sort of animatronics that move the story from one play to another.\n\nThe gunplay is good, but finnicky - if you generally play with a gamepad, don't. It's far too frustrating, and I ended up just using mouse/keyboard. Not a deal breaker for me, but something to be aware of if you care about this. \n\nDriving is atrocious. I walked across the city and wasted time instead of taking a car because the controls are so absolutely awful when it comes to steering. I avoided any driving like the plague. \n\nMods do a lot for this game, but I didn't find myself invested enough to take the time to get more than a few before I let it go. \n\nIn a game that feels like there should always be something happening or something to do, I shut it down one day and just never felt compelled to really pick it back up. If there were an option for \"indifferent,\" I would've picked that recommendation, but I marked this as recommended because it functions correctly, and though it may not be my cup of tea, you might like it. But honestly it feels like an uninspired mess of great ideas that never got the time necessary to craft them into something that mattered.",

        "content": "I originally made a review saying this game was a little worse than okay. I WAS WRONG.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a rather good game I just don't play RPGs well. The game has a very memorable and honestly amazing story. Most of the mechanics are great like the shooting and the hacking, especially the hacking. Throw all the cool cyberware you can use on top and the combat is very enjoyable. The art direction of the game is great and the environments look great most of the time, sometimes the environment can be a bit boring. Overall the game is fantastic but there are problems to it such as there is simply not much in the way of recreational things to do, annoying parts you have to force yourself through (some of the braindances if not all), the flashback scenes, and of course the MANY BUGS IT STILL HAS. \n\nI have played the game day one, it somehow feels buggier than ever. 2020 it felt fine for me with an occasional hiccup, now in 2022 I keep seeing cars and people getting sent into the sky, I touch a car and it flips, the map flashbangs my eyeballs now, sometimes the cool side missions dont work anymore, I have had to restart several times to get the most out of this game.\n\nEven with all that I still do recommend the game but I would wait for a sale, currently in its state of bugginess it feels like a $45 game then a $60 game. If it didn;t have the bugs oh definitely $60.\n\nSide note: Go watch the anime Cyberpunk Edgerunners, it was the best 4 hours I spent binging a show.",

Most of the controversy and people sobbing about bugs and performance came from console players trying to play the game on more than a decade old consoles, and a bunch of mob mentality that caused other people to blindly parrot the same slogans without actually experiencing them personally. The biggest mistake CDPR made was even bothering to try and release the game for those consoles, not that it didn't run well on them. This game aimed to push video game graphics of our time to their limits, it was insanity to think it would function on those ancient machines.",

I did crash a couple times but that after a heavy play through and it worked perfectly after that. \n\nI don't regret buying this game I would recommend this to friends to play.

        "content": "Initial Response:\n\nA fun action packed open world game that provides you with a narrative regarding the life and death of a sole being in a trans-humanistic world that goes beyond and above with its story of Johnny Silverhand and his vehicle, V. The gameplay is there but the story needs to be expanded on and increased in order to provide characters that are involved with the game and its main story missions. The initial release would be most demanding because of the lack of Quality of life checks that did not allow for immersive play or the lack of mechanical checks that would allow the game to be good as it is. I won't go into detail here about what was bad or good. We kinda already know.\n\n1.5 Release:\n\nPros: \nMajor Bug Fixes and preventative measures for continued gameplay.\nInventory System is pretty much fixed with a few probably needed gear update with either all craftable skins and dye coloring and maybe a transmutation system.\nFPS checks out pretty well on a 3070ti in general\nLOVE the gunplay still and the much needed mods makes it more fun\n\nCons:\nCops seem to be still broken and don't \"respond\" like it would be expected like in GTA....They still magically show up.\nStory Updates desperately needed: Expansion, Free DLC, a bit of re-writing of side characters of Evelyn Parker or like Victor and Jackie of course. More origin story references. I like the dialogue responses but its not enough. I feel like the Corpo and Nomad backgrounds you should at least be somewhat known in the scenes of those two backstories. \nMORE MAXTAC- I got sold on the game back in 2011 with the first trailer and we honestly needed more of them. \nMore modifcations: Gear and cyberware wise. I feel like they had more than enough information and sci-fi to implement more cyberware into your character, as well as possibly change your appearance like gorilla arms and such. \n\nThe game has bugs there and there....floating cars like I was in Interstellar for a moment or something.\n\nThe game needs mostly its story updates. CDPR got bumrushed by investors and had to make dangerous compromises it feels like. This is no excuse of course but I fail to see how one can go from the Witcher 3 and than get slammed on this.\n\n\n",

Learn to love experiences for what they are, not what the internet wanted them to be.\n\nI bought this game on sale for half off, after the worst bugs and glitches were patched out. And I have had one hell of an experience. The journey through night city is an adrenaline packed adventure, littered with suprisingly deep character interactions filled with emotion and humanity.\n\nThe gameplay was fun, the city was a sight to behold and a joy to explore, the soundtrack was fantastic, and the characters were the absolute best thing about the experience.\n\nI only experienced two game-breaking bugs that were easily fixed with a quick save-reload, the rest of the glitches were honestly just hilarious to witness and gave me a few good laughs.\n\nIn the end, this game made me feel an intense range of emotions, made me feel for the characters that I interacted with, gave me adrenaline rushes during combat, and gave me a good 107 hours of enjoyment. When the credits rolled I honestly found myself wanting more, so I'm gonna return to night city eventually, because I truly enjoyed this game.",

However, knowing that's a thing going in makes it easier to see past it to the potential underneath. The game has soul, even if the body is broken. Worth the $44 I paid for it, but glad I didn't pay full price.\n\nEDIT: over 100 hours later and I am completely hooked. Despite the jank and bugs (and I'm convinced there's less and less of both the longer I play), you can't deny the amount of effort that went into this game. Threw a few mods on it to fix the worst of the jank, but the driving remains awful: cars feels like shopping carts on a bouncing castle and motorbikes feel identical to cars...seriously, does no one at CDPR ride bikes? You can't drift a bike the same as a car, it'll high side! But janky vehicles aside, the game is a winner. 9/10, would get quickhacked by V again.\n\n\n",

I don't want to spoil anything but honestly just take your time and enjoy it and make sure you are using all of the dialogue options to get all extra options out of the way, plus its just nice to be able to flesh out the lore of the world.\n\nGlitches do happen for example every time I start a new game after the prologue there is a cutscene that is full of montages. I have still not seen it because every time it tries to play I get a bunch of headless bodies standing in a T pose gliding around the screen with audio behind it. They aren't often or game breaking but things like the character models losing animation is pretty common (most of the time when I talk to an NPC the audio comes out but their mouths or bodies are stuck in an idle animation.)\n\nTLDR;\nGood story and game play that will take you as long as you want and be enjoyable the whole time but has some performance issues on most devices but they don't tend to be game breaking.",

        "content": "Right, lets get the obvious out of the way first: Although the game has seen plenty of patches to fix the worst of the glitches (and they have fixed alot of them), its far from perfect. There are glitches, some of them break the immersion and some are very subtle, but they still exist.\n\nWith that out of the way. Cyberpunk 2077 is one of my favourite games i have ever played. The world, the characters and the protagonist V are all super well done and they all feel like people, not NPCs. The world is depressive and dystopian, but yet so beautiful. I dont know how they did it but you will learn to both hate and love Night City, which is a very shared feeling in the game world it seems.\nThe different story arcs including the main storyline are also done with care and love, and you genuinely feel for the main protagonist V as their story is told. The different skill trees you can unlock and work your hours into feel distinct and interesting, and they make for unique and fun gameplay.\n\nAnd if that didnt sell it enough, Keanu Reeves has a major role in the whole game. He and CDPR put their heart and soul into this game, its very easy to tell.",

        "content": "Before I say anything, check the time played. 143 hours. I finished every side mission, bought every car, rented every apartment, found all the tarot signs. I highly enjoyed this game and did not feel ripped off in any way. That being said, here's everything wrong with it.\n\n1. I was under the impression that the bugs were mostly fixed, especially for the PC version. If that's true, holy crap, I don't know how it was even playable before now. This games is more buggy than initial release Fallout New Vegas. Just expect several bugs per mission. I'm talking things exploding randomly, things popping into existence, textures not loading, t-poses, people riding invisible motorcycles, sunglasses floating in front of your vision, text boxes and ricochet lines that won't go away until your reload, loot and people that sink into the ground. Heck, the final boss got trapped inside a door and I the only way I could beat him was to throw 100 grenades in the general area. \n\n2. Night City is huge but that's not necessarily a good thing. The city is completely lifeless. And by that I mean it has no personality. Not one inch of it memorable. I couldn't tell one you the name of one location. I know exactly what Megaton looks like in Fallout 3. I know exactly what Sanctuary looks like in Borderlands 2. But all of Night City is basically a generic template. Which brings me to the biggest flaw...\n\n3. Everything Cyberpunk 2077 does, some other game has done better. Cyberpunk was supposed to be this revolutionary new game, filled with things we had never seen before. But GTA does open world better. Borderlands does loot better. The Witcher does characters better. Far Cry does combat better. Deus Ex does body modification better. Fallout does everything better. Everything in Cyberpunk is a not quite as good version of something we've already seen.\n\n4. The music is garbage. The vehicle call feature sometimes spawns your vehicle somewhere you can't get it. The lore isn't worth reading. Every piece of garbage has its own hit box, which means driving through it is like driving through giant LEGO pieces. There aren't that many weapons. There is no 3rd person, which means if you want to see yourself, you have to go into photo mode. \n\n5. The fist fighting side quests are some of the worst quests I've ever played in any game. The mechanics are so broken that any punch the opponent throws from anywhere within a mile radius hits you for half your health. I wouldn't even have bothered to finish them if I didn't figure out that you can just shoot them before the fight and still complete the quests.\n\nThat being said:\n\n1. The voice acting is phenomenal. I met a hundred characters and every one of them sounded exactly how they should sound.\n\n2. For all its bugs, the game is still fun. Especially combat. The story is intriguing. The side characters are interesting. If there's a DLC with Judy, I'll probably buy it. The fact that all the side characters dropped off the map after their story was told made me sad that I couldn't see them anymore. Even Jackie, who was only in the intro, left an impression.\n\n3. 143 hours. This in no way feels like an incomplete game. I had a blast. I rampaged Night City, broke some hearts, partied hard, saved a few robot cars, changed a few lives, and let an old rocker have a few more years in the spotlight. They'll be talking about me for decades. I have no regrets.",

        "content": "This game has some pros and cons to it:\n\nPro: number ONE; Johnny Silverhand is with you 100% of the time, and it's Keanu Reeves at his best with him.  It's great.\nThe city feels good, and each area of it really pops.  Areas feel unique without feeling like you just walked into a new area so the scene changes now.  \nCombat is fun, by the halfway mark, you'll have a style down based on your character.  It'll work, somehow.  Super stealth hacker knife expert?  Or just... punch things?  So many inbetween but they all feel capable. Except for stacking everything in to Gorilla arms, then you just can't die and you laugh at the fragile meat sacks.\nCharacters are fun, likable, or effortlessly detestable, and you'll get to interact accordingly.  There's rarely a time when you have a problem that has an option you wouldn't take.  \n\nCons: cars suck.  Seriously, the driving in this game feels awful.  \nThe map is hard to navigate because places aren't named, you kind of have to guess where things you want to see are, and it prevents good exploration.\nCharacters are great!  You'll be able to interact with... seven of them.  I know it's not a game where you're supposed to \"make all the friends\" it's actually story over open world, but I wanted more characters to chill with.\nYou'll make an awesome character, that you'll only see in the pause menu... \nI never found a good reason to get in trouble with the police and take on Max Tech... real missed opportunity.\nThere's not \"enough\" things in the city to push you to explore every corner, which is sad, because holy crap it would  be nice.\nThere are locked doors in the city that do nothing, and can't be opened, and it makes no sense.",

[spoiler] i chose the devil ending, i had to go back to save takemura, did no side quests, only what was necessary to get the achievement [/spoiler] if you choose to do all the main character's storylines, it should take around 35 or 40 hours to finish, i think.\n\nbeyond that, this game is gorgeous, even on medium quality graphics. the story is thrilling and so immersive, and i really hope future patches and updates give more options and stories to play through. each ending left me sitting there in tears, and i loved every second of it.\n\nif you're a fan of anything cyberpunk, keanu reeves, or open worlds, this is worth the money.",

Almost 2 yrs since that, and I'm now playing this beautiful, well crafted and heartbreaking world in VR. This game is right up there in my list as Skyrim, and I hope the modding community sees agrees with me cause like Skyrim and minecraft, i don't want this game to end.",

Beyond that great game, take it for what it is,get excited for the dlc when it drops,and just enjoy cyberpunk.",

Well it certainly had a rocky start but in my opinion it's one of the best games I've ever played, yes there's the odd bug but given the game is running on an engine that is completely unique in what it does it's fantastic. Now the replayability depends on each person's playstyle etc but for me I've played nearly 500 hours and I'm still finding new ways to play, new things to discover, plus the city is perfect setting for those who want to play as they want too without judgement. Lastly to sum up with mods available, the next patch due soon which will most likely include a couple new dlc &  gigs etc and a massive expansion coming early next year this game can easily continue the trend and make a comeback similar to no mans sky which is why I 100% recommend this!",

I could just go on and on about how many things i loved about this game, but i'm not going to.\n\nThe game isn't perfect at all, but still i enjoyed it more, than anything i've played recently. Could've have been more, but it's still a great game. Looks really good too, if you play on high settings. \n\nSide jobs are a must imo, you can't fully experience the game without those missions, there are few really good ones.\nEven tho i finished the game, i'm gonna be thinking about it for a while that's for sure.",

The aesthetic that the scenery fulfills is more than enough to make up for the bugs and so far the story has been very good.  It is a strong point of the game. Combat is fun and they give you a good range of playstyles with multiple story paths. Solid 7.9/10",

        "content": "[h1] General Opinion [/h1]\nI have ended up enjoying the game, a whole bunch more than I thought I would. (60+ hours on my first playthough, as of writing this) \nA bunch of quests seem to start off as \"by-the-numbers\", but end up taking a massive, surprising turns.\n  I've enjoyed most of even the most \"basic\" side quests.  I often feel myself getting drawn into the world, and caring about even minor characters.\n\nCombat is promising, but not quite there.  It usually boils down to how much DPS your weapons have. (I use the monofiber, sniper rifle, smart AI pistol combo).   The enemies are either far too easy, or deal far too much damage. Either you mop the floor with them, or find yourself continuously healing. Netrunning/hacking is still always fun though.    Stealth runs are more fun, but there really is no advantage for going stealth over aggressive. (Save for maybe 5 quests that will net you some extra cash, but honestly not much more).\n\nThe Romance quests are surprisingly detailed.  I found myself genuinely caring about some NPCs, and their wants and needs.   I actually grew attached to Judy, and wish there were more romance scenes for the characters.\n\n\n For those of you who are familiar with the commerical spoilers, it still hits really hard, even when you know it is coming. I found myself calling his number, even 40+ hours of gameplay later, hoping he would pickup. A lot of the characters feel really fleshed out in this game.\n\nThe NPCs often feel very genuine and authentic.  I even HATE Johnny as a PERSON (not as a NPC), but I can still empathize with him.  He isn't just some random \"by the numbers\" character.  He actually seems like a real person, who I even found myself agreeing with sometimes.   He isn't designed as some random character you are supposed to hate/like.  He feels like a real person, despite being an asshole, still has his moments of genuine insight and humanity.\n\nFor my first playthough, I ended up playing someone who romanced Judy, and found myself genuinely invested in her quests, and upset when things didn't go her way. I was also surprised to find out that certain characters have actual preferences, like real people do.  still feel embarrassed for hitting on Panam, and getting shot down. (So much, that I reloaded to avoid said situation. XD )\n\nI didn't just grow to \"like\" the characters in this game. I became ATTACHED to them.  I honestly wanted to help them, and learn more about them.  Cept for Joshua... Guy creeped me right the hell out.\n\nThe writing/character development is really THAT good.  A lot of the quests are seriously thought provoking. I honestly found myself conflicted between certain actions in the game.  There are actually quite a few non-black&white, clear-cut decisions you can make in the game.    \n They don't feel like random NPCs who \"you are supposed to like or hate\". They feel like real people.  Story-writing and voice acting at it's best.  Still wish I could go the romance route with Claire.  :P \n\n[h1]BUGS[/h1]\nI've run into a few irritating bugs (mostly during the Racing quests, where you suddenly hit invisible objects, or have enemy racers literally spawn right in front of, including at the finish line).\n\nBut I've only encountered 2 actual game-breaking bugs.\n\n[spoiler]\nOne is at the GIM, where if you fight the Animal boss before checking the van, which results in all 3 doors locking you out, to progress the quest.\n\nThe other was when I fought against the Voodoo Boys. There is a small room you can walk into, and the doors will close behind you. If you don't have enough Body/Lockpicking, you are stuck permanently. \n[/spoiler]\n\nI ended up downloading Vortex and using the wall-clipping mod to escape both glitches.  Haven't touched it since.\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]\nA really fun world to explore. I WANT to see  and meet the people in this world and see how they tick. I WANT to play the different lifestyles to see what is different.\n\nBut the bugs... the freaking bugs.  There are quire a few small ones. But still enough to jar you out of the game-world.  T-Pose walking NPCs,  hitting random invisible objects, beating a heavy-weight champion at a boxing match, because he got stuck on a chair (Can we say \"Gut-punch at Body 6\"?), waiting 2 minutes for a stupid NPC van to drive up to a spot... It's all there.\n\nThe game's world feels very authentic and amazing. Combat is kind of wonky, but still enjoyable. Storytelling is freaking AMAZING! Even IF you try to go asshole/jerk route, it still flows pretty well.\n\nI would still recommend grabbing it on a major discount, though.  I mean 40% or more type of discount.\nStory and World building in the game are really good, but the combat, and bugs especially can make it taxing.\n\nStill, give it a try, if you have the spare cash.",

I feel like the story, setting, and realism of it all (if you don't count the bugs) really sends a message about reality and how a sad and horrible future like this could be very real someday, if it wasn't for the game breaking bugs it could probably convey this message a little better. Honestly if you're actually invested in the story and game go ahead and buy it but if you're just looking for a cyberpunk themed combat experience this is not for you. Also PLEASE make sure you have a decent computer for this, your small 2012 refurbished eBay school computer will explode in your face if you try to run at high or medium settings.",

        "content": "Bottom line, if you enjoy sci-fi action, and don't mind the cyberpunk aesthetic, this game, well, it's pretty great. \n\nThere are few games with this thorough of a story. Doesn't hurt that it's a story that I really enjoyed. Sure, there are better stories out there, but the integration of this story across many, many aspects of the game is very fun. You never know when you're going to stumble across a tidbit of information that matters.\n\nThe voice acting is top notch as well. Seriously, I can sit back and enjoy fem V's roller coaster of emotions for hours. Great acting! Even when the visual scene is boring, the voice acting pulls me into the story, big time. I really hope that further DLC offer more voiced lines, or even a full prequel game that explores V's life before Night City. Cherami Leigh made an awesome V, I want more. \n\nThe game itself is a fun shooter, with some RPG-inspired options. Your choices can make a difference on the little things, but there's no way to drastically diverge from the author's intentions for the main story, you end up in the same place in the end no matter what. I wish I had more control over which of my allies I can bring to the final battle, if any. At the very least, I wish my actions made more of a difference to who survives; spoiler alert, one of your acquaintances will die at the end, and there's nothing you can do to stop it.\n\nIn the end, I am a huge fan of this game. I enjoy the base game play, happy to run around the map for hours just taking it all in. Mods are your friend if you are here for the story more than the action, as you will have to manage some gang wars in order to keep the story flowing.\n\nI say again, if you're excited for a good story, pick up this game. If all you want is a shooter, well, it's fun, but not as robust as the dedicated shooters out there.",

I knew I'd be playing this again but, we'll get to that shortly... here is what I thought (apologies for any minor spoilers here, there won't be many)\n\nIn terms of character build, my go to is a stealthy play style and wanted to be a Corporate sneaky hacker... and we'll get to that shortly as well...\n\nFirst impressions of the game are like woah - really ambitious world building. Night City is a triumph of design, full and rich in design. Easily one of the best city sandboxes I've played in. There is some goofy stuff going on occasionally, cars magically driving into the floor and stuff like that, but it's generally ok, nothing I have not seen before in other city sandboxes.\n\nDriving around the city - as cool as Night City looks - is not always that fun however. I couldn't place my finger on why but ultimately I concluded it was because none of the vehicles were that interesting or varied. I mean, there are a lot of vehicle types, and they all look the part, but driving them felt a little flat and underwhelming. I generally stuck to one of the first vehicles you get, a motorbike, simply because it was the nippiest to get around when I needed it, or fast travelled.\n\nOne very nice touch with the vehicles is that you can summon any you own at any time - I appreciate this feature greatly.\n\nSo let's talk about missions. In typical open world style we've got main  missions, side missions and what I'd call side-side-missions, to which there are a few variants. \n\nSide-side missions are a mixed bag; Steal something, rescue someone, kill someone etc. I found these quite fun, kind of reminiscent of Deus Ex HR side missions in that there was always more than one option for the player to complete it. Being a stealth hacker with knives these were no problem - even if it kicked off I was able to mangle through it.\n\nThere are also these missions called Cyberpsychos where you've got to either kill or capture a person who has gone a bit mad from all the mods they've installed up their arse - These are fun and varied in that each one have a different 'thing' about them - one might be a sniper, and one might be an invisible katana wielding ninja, you get subtle clues just before the encounter. It was interesting to get some background on the person afterwards (like context as to why they went crazy) I challenged myself to capture these guys instead of outright killing them - which unfortunately doesn't make a huge difference (as far as I could tell anyway)\n\nOrdinary side quests are to give you depth to some of the other main characters in the game - I hardly explored some of the characters, like Panam I think I did the one main quest and never spoke to her again. I intend to on the next play through.\n\nA frustrating part of the character interactions linked to the side quests was that I found 'V' as your character, sometimes was completely off point with some of the dialogue choices. Most of the time you're a hard arse, but other times, out of no-where, you're almost too empathic and caring, I disliked this inconsistency and it actually became quite distracting at times. It felt like the game was not letting me play like I wanted to play.\n\nThe main mission and overarching story of the game is -ok- I'm not sure if the point got lost on me or I was distracted by other factors but I found the main plot was alright. During my play through I had to reload a save from one mission due to a bug, where a vehicle I had to tail ended up inside a wall and couldn't move, but otherwise I never found any other game breaking bugs. There are a few other glips like enemies seeing bodies through walls, or reloading a save and enemies are 'alerted' for no reason - nothing that really caused me a big issue though.\n\nI found the gunplay pretty good. There is a decent selection of weapons. I tried sticking to my throwing knives and katana loadout mostly but you do need to shoot sometimes and the game encourages, even forces a shootout sometimes. Guys dodging bullets in realtime Matrix style, the first time you see it is like - holy sh*t that looks good!\n\nQuick hacking during a fight is pretty awesome too - even if it is like casting digital spells, it still felt cool to overload a guys optics just before stepping out and slicing his head off - Never saw it comin'\n\nWhat I wanted to say about a stealthy play style; You're not particularly rewarded for being passive or stealthy. It's also not possible sometimes to stealth certain sections - although oddly stealth is really encouraged a lot of the time. There is even an optic camo mod that really helps you out in this aspect, but you should know stealth is not the primary mode of play in CP2077, IMO. Shooting is.\n\nI have to talk about Keanu Reeves' role in Cyberpunk as Jonny Silverhand. I genuinely thought it was some sort of marketing gimmick, a celebrity endorsement, that he'd play a small 5 minute role, and boy I was wrong - His role in the game is probably one of the strongest out of all the characters. [small spoiler in the remainder of this paragraph] Anyone who played Batman Arkham Night, where Joker appears to Batman in the environment, makes comments or jokes, or gives an opinion on something - this is a lot like what Jonny role is for a large part of CP2077. Even in small side quests he can appear when you don't expect it, and has lines of dialogue that are sometimes humorous or insightful. Sometimes he just appears and is looking at something. I can't talk too much about this character as he is tied into the main story line, but I was really impressed with his dialogue and voice acting throughout. [end of spoiler]\n\nCharacter development to me, seemed to be broken - From what I understand, if you invest points in a skill tree, you should get more perks for that tree, but I never did. I only ended up with about 5 perks and couldn't seem to add any more points into that tree. This was especially obvious with the ninjitsu tree, I unlocked everything I could, it was practically my main weapon (a dagger and a katana) yet I never seemed to be able to progress it any further than the initial unlocks. Next play through I'm going to figure this out.\n\nThere is also a crafting aspect to the game, which I can honestly say I never used. I can't really see its place in the game, seems a bit pointless when in every fight / mission you'll likely find a new weapon which is better than you're old one. You can also upgrade your weapons and clothes and stuff - but again, I was never short up upgrades from people I'd just killed.\n\nSo to sum up... This is CD Projekt and they gave us Witcher. They clearly worked hard and attempted to deliver something big, and anything following Witcher 3 would be extremely difficult to top.... I can't make excuses for the initial release of CP2077 and I certainly have not found CP2077 to be as impactful or profound as Witcher but despite its flaws, its definitely a good game. I would recommend it.",

Although dialogs might become too repetitive too soon, the comments while on a fight or a shooting are great. The details are everywhere, from a simple poster on a random wall, to a whole area filled with buildings, people, graffiti, garbage on the floor, fantastic sunny landscapes contrasted with rainy nights, and, well, Mr. Reeves of course.\nIt is a great experience and a joy to play.",

        "content": "Full disclaimer: I was not there for the seemingly bumpy start. There are certainly some things to iron out, but on the whole I must say it did not disappoint!\n\nHere's a quick sumup:\n\n- Deep and varied storyline, albeit a little short for my liking. I've only played through once (Nomad) so far, but I will gladly play it again with a different start!\n- Stunning graphics if your rig is up for it!\n- The combat system is great as it allows for great variety in how you want to play the game, adding to the replayability\n\n- Purchasing new vehicles feels a little too strict for my liking. I don't feel there's a reason to limit in the way the game does; by being offered to purchase them once you've completed a number of gigs/events for leaders around the city\n- Although I appreciate the variety in the combat system, it does lack in cuztomisation in other parts of the game. There is for instance no customization for vehicles (at time of writing) and very limited possibilites for apartments (the latter I mind the least). It would be really cool if had the options to actually use the workbenches already located in the apartment though, whereas now it does feel a quite bare.\n- The city at times feels incredibly empty! I was driving down the highways for quite some time and only ever saw 3 cars max. The city centre works fine for me, and it's often packed with people - it's where the city actually feels alive.\n- I experienced a few bugs along the way and while they're not really anything to be upset about, I don't particularly enjoy watching NPCs or mission characters flat out disappear! Only by scanning I could see the mission characters at least had fallen through the ground into the vast nothing. I would recommend saving your game before starting a new Main Mission or Side Job, just to be on the safe side!\n\nThe negatives does however not outweigh the now positives for me. The game had a captivating storyline to me, but I reckon I'll wait for my next playthrough until they've done a bit more patching.",

If the game could have at least launched with what the 1.5 patch fixed, then this game would be very very well regarded. \n\nThe launch definitely rocked CDPR's reputation, but the product now, at least to me, redeems them a little.

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077, The setting and story is amazing. One of the better sci-fi games out there. The characters are rich and mostly (not all) believable. But the looming detriment to the player is the game's mechanics, some clunky systems and overall how it (game play) can fall apart towards the end of the game.\n\nThere are bugs that can create frustration - like enemies attacking while stuck under the ground. Driving off-road can/will feel messy. Cyberware that doesn't have clear ties to certain perks/skills or attributes. Successfully using stealth weapons/skills against enemies and alerting an entire mob to your location. Character freezes, quest crashes, NPC glitches, and so on. But with that being said, Night City is an amazing place to explore and adventure in. The voice acting is good, the action is very good - though I would have liked it a little more had there been an option for 3rd person view while using melee. A lot of the missions are very well thought out and I LOVE how I really felt a part of the culture of Night City!\n\nCyberpunk has an amazing story and the setting is truly a marvel. There are issues, but open world games are extremely hard to make (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, No Mans Sky etc.) and I believe despite the bugs this game is an underrated gem. It's not perfect, but I think it adds to the charm. People today are way too hyper critical and we sometimes forget to just have fun! Cyberpunk IS fun! Give it a try and support the future of Cyberpunk.",

If you don't mind small bugs here and there every so often then I really think its worth trying it out for yourself. Most of the Major bugs and issues have been patched and so far only have experience one game breaking bug that was resolved with a quick \"did you turn it off and on again\" method with no major setbacks in progression. I do recommend having a decent spec PC and an SSD if you want the most out of the game thought but if you don'd mind lowering the graphics a little then by all means go for it.

I was surprised how much I really enjoyed myself, and was ready for my next play session. The few actual glitches and bugs I ran into were either barely noticeable or not game breaking.

        "content": "After putting in near to 600 hrs on the base PS4 the moment it launched on the 10th of December in 2020, and now after purchasing it again for PC and clocking in at almost 400 hrs so, I can honestly safely say this is hands down one of the best and my favorite game and let me explain why. [b] SPOILERS LIKE HEAVY FUCKING SPOILERS READ AT YOUR OWN WILL [/b]\n[h1]The Story [/h1]\nThis is the main reason I was interested in the game and pre-ordered it. It is no doubt the best story I have ever experienced in the whole entirety of my gaming career of course, you got RDR 2 (second best to cp2077 for me), TLOU, The Witcher and just many other fantastic games out there the reason cyberpunk to me is far better than the ones I mentioned is that this was just an engaging roller coaster of emotions from feeling happy to pissed, being loved then just straight up fucking depressed. I fucking adore how the game does this to me I have never felt so many emotions in one game RDR 2 did this to me but Cyberpunk took it to a whole other level. So firstly the premise of the game you play as V a customizable character from head to toe who is a merc accompanied by his/her best friend Jackie, Jackie informs V of a one in a lifetime Job a heist guaranteed to go flawlessly with a huge reward it's a simple job all you have to do is Gain access to the penthouse of the CEO of one of the enormous corporations in the world and steal a Biochip that is in its trial phases what could go wrong? EVERYTHING after almost being caught to thinking youve escaped and then actually being caught a battle through the building to escape in one of Night Citys most courteous chauffeurs, Delamain an ai controlled cab company that provide you a premium bulletproof escape with drones hunting you down shortly realizing you best friend needs medical assistance immediately delemain refusing to do so then your best choom dying right in your hands after meeting up with dex and being double crossed the chip Jackie gave to you by putting it in your neural socket revives you and now you got one badass but a goddam fucking pest of character for the rest of your journey, Johnny Silverhand who is taking over your body but that's the chips doing not his Now you gotta figure out a way to get rid of this chip.\n[h1] The Characters [/h1]\nOH BOY the characters are fucking top notch in this game there never was a dull moment with any of the characters during my journey in Night City. Every character was so well crafted I did not think id be so emotionally attached to these characters even if they weren't in the game for long they are all made beaitifully from the phenomenal voice acting to their facial animations each character is unique and got their own story to tell. I never would have imagined a game would make me this attached and in love with its characters, let me make an example for one, Judy we all know Judy weather you have or havent played the game if you have been in the community you more than likely have heard about Judy, so Judy is a romancable character for your character (female only) she's a lesbian, getting to know her personality see who she really is and what she does is beautiful, its remarkable the character development, once the main part of the romance arc happens its just such a beautiful mission and this is where you get to know all about Judy, her past life, where she grew up and such, its such a beautiful moment in this game shortly there after you have a very spicy intimate scene with her, the morning after is adorable she asks you what last night meant and if you want to move in with her and the messages you recieve from her later through the game is just amazing this game even made me feel like i was in an actual relathionship for example the other romance option for female V is a detective named River his storyline is fantastic and once it got to the romance part i felt bad denying him but if i chose to do it then i wouldve felt bad for Judy cause it be cheating (even tho this isnt a thing in the game) on her but also if you play her storyline she was such a likable character and it be just fucked to do that god dam id never thought a game would make me feel this way especially with certain endings and how your romance character will react some are just dowright heartbreaking to one juts being fucking depresing.\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nGunplay honestly feels fucking unique there are always different ways I can approach enemies, guns blazing, hacking, stealth, and just straight up fist fight all of them it's great to be able to do this and let me touch on gunplay for a sec, there's a few ways you can go about this longrange, up close and personal midrange or mix them up still another thing is sometimes during gunplay I swear id be playing it like if it was DOOM, just running up with a heavy ass shotgun blowing heads off gun butting the guy behind tearing off his torso with a shotgun to the chest then jumping over the next guy and blowing his back out also the hacking route can go a few ways full lethal hacking to being a distraction artist, there are so many ways to approach your enemies.\n[h1] The Environment/Graphics [/h1]\nDon't even get me started on how gorgeous this game is if its anything everyone can agree upon with this game it is how amazing the game looks and just the detail and the glorious landscapes and the city, the city is always bustling with life, like there are alot of npcs like alot (for me atleast) also differnt time of the day also changes the amount of npcs or just the location, every district is unique with its looks and people for example in the more downtown part of the game where the high end clothing stores are you are going to see npcs that are wearing more buisness like clothes also more high end vehicles, the dessert or known as the badlands is just a vast wasteland with what youd expect to see out there vehcles built for the environment and not alot of people. Night City is hands down easily one of the most stunning cities in a game to date no argument required.\n[h1] Audio [/h1]\nCyberpunks sounds are just on another level, from the ambiance to the music down to each engine and startup of every vehicle, each gun variant sounding different form punchy to techy. The music is just unbeatable. It's got something for everyone from Jazz to fucking Metal, and a lot of the clothing you can wear all have their own sounds. There is so much detail its actually underappreciated, its just an eargasm.\n[h1] Side content [/h1]\n There is a decent chunk of side missions to do some feel like they're part of the main story, but they aren't It's just side missions then you got your side jobs they are the same thing but it's just for cash so it is what it is. Every game has it. \n[h1] End Game [/h1]\nWell there is really no end game basically no matter the ending you die so there isn't anything for you after completing the game some people hate that in games which is fair but if you played the fucking game idk why you'd be mad but doesn't mean you can't play the game anymore and have to do another run through the game takes you to a save before the ending so you can finish up additional content or just continue exploring about or try the other endings.\n[h1] Final Verdict [/h1]\nCyberpunk 2077 is a gem of a game. Yes it has a lot of flaws and problems but it is a one in a million some people may say how or why well did you read my review? The game is addicting, entertaining, has a gripping story, amazing environments, phenomenal characters and just an all-around great game to play, it constantly sucks me back into play even tho I've 100% this game way too many times than id like to admit. solid 8 to 9 out of 10",

The characters are brilliantly well done and the music is killer. Only gripe I have is that I wish there were more 'main story' styled elements. there's so much to do in the setting, I don't think it would've been a stretch.\n\nWould 100% recommend though.",

There's a lot of potental here, but greedy developers with insane deadlines ruined it.\nClose to 50 hours and still no change, cars will randomly appear as i'm driving, my car will crash while driving on the road and there's nothing in front of me. And now the game is causing my computer to crash when trying to load a quick save. I will beat this stupid game, but holy crap am i glad i never paid full price for a half finished game.",

This game seems to take mods really well, surprisingly.\nReshades, the FSR 2.0 mod, and modded ray tracing to hit around 100 FPS make this game look incredible, breathtaking, if you will.\n\nThere were so many missing features at release, but I can't really think of anything major that's missing at this point besides a proper lengthy intro chapter with Jackie.\nWanted flying cars? There's a mod for it.\nNo transit system? There's a mod for it.\nWanted system feels bare bone? There's a mod for it.\nClothes look like something out of a dried up flea market? There are mods for it.\nHate censorship? Plenty of mods for that.\nGranted, they're mods, so they may not be up to absolute AAA standards, but they get really close.\n\nAside from the occasional miniature adult NPC T-posing with their head up the exhaust pipe of a Veyron, I'd say this is an easy buy (and a redownload for those that jumped ship).",

I have a 3070 ROG and sometimes the game would drop me down to 12-14 FPS either because there were a lot of things going on or just for the hell of it.\n--You can reset perks, but not attributes. And you can only get a limited amount of levels to your attributes. Which really hurts when you want to test out other builds.\n\nOverall, I had a lot of fun playing it.

I waited almost 2 years to play it and I encountered zero gamedecisive bugs. Some glitches here and there, but nothing all too serious.\n\nThe game itself is stunning. I've never seen anything more detailed in my whole videogamer life. The detail that went into the city is gorgeous. The story is really entertaining, it's the first time in my videogamer life, too, for me to completely (and I mean 100 %) play a game to the end in every regard. And I would play on for some additional hundreds of hours, if there would be content (one of the flaws of this game is, after the story ends, there isn't really much to do left, you for sure can wander the city, but there's not much enemies left and no real challenge possible).\n\nOne huge flaw - as always with console prioritized games - is the driving. Devs, for whatever reasons, didn't implement mouse-steering, so your cars (if you don't use a controller) fly from left to right within a ms, making it very frustrating to drive in the game. I really can't understand what's so damn difficult to think about PC players as well and code some sort of mouse-steering. Can't be that difficult.\n\nAnyways - all in all, this is a game, easily getting into my Top 10, rather around the first than the last places. It's insane fun to play this if you like cyberpunk (I play CPR as tabletop as well) and in general if you like this typical futuristic Blade-Runner-esque feeling, cyberware etc.\n\nHighly recommend this game.",

        "content": "For the current price at 30\u20ac in the Steam-Store and even as low as 15\u20ac on some key-shops, I can recommend this game alone for being a great sandbox and its amazing graphics. The cutscenes, music and some side quests are also very good. Overall, the main story is solid and interesting, but doesn't quiet manage to deliver a mind blowing twist. You get great value for the money, the game just could not keep up with the extraordinary expectations.\n\nThats's especially true for the combat system, mission design, skill tree, hacking and looting. And because of these deficits in the main aspects of gameplay, I can not recommend Cyperpunk 2077 as a great RPG. The open world looks amazing, but unlike Elden Ring, there is not so much where you really feel the urge to discover. \n\nBut play it as an interactive movie, a city-sandbox and don't forget to try out the photo mode for amazing screen shots and I guarantee you, that are not going to regret the investment. I would give Cyberpunk at least 90/100, it might just not be what it initially had tried to achieve and what the fans had hoped for.\n\nAlso, at least for the first 20 hours, when I played it without being conterminated by the common negative consensus of the reviews by players, it managed to keep my hopes up high and felt at first like it could really be the promised big thing. First start and character creation already made an amazing impression. Then the pace of the intro and polished cut scenes.  All the small features and fresh ideas that hinted a lot of potential. For example, the brain dance was an astonishing game mechanic as well as a story theme that they should have made much more use of instead of those stupid hacking games. \n\nGive me an expansion with just 20 hours of well designed brain dance puzzles where the character whose memories you are reliving are moving across the whole city, interact with more NPCs and the covered times pan is longer. Paired with some philosophical questions that technologies brings up (I am sure in 2077 there are going to be at least a few rare specimen among mankind who can come up with better ideas than recording porn and crucifications...), the right mix for a great Cyberpunk-game that can revive that legendary Matrix-feeling is so near to grasp! \n\n\n",

I loved the first version even with all the snafus.   deleted it.  bought the update and am  broadcasting my playthrough on www.streamlabs.com/getacustomone/home or just on twitch at www.twitch.tv/getacustomone i love this game.  the graphics are stunning beyond description, the environment is vast AF,  cars handle well,  narratives and sub narratives as well as sense of actual environments with people doing their thing.  also i really loved the combat and difficulty of play and opponents different combat techniques - from gang banger, to cyberpunk to Arasaka or  Militech or nomad, cyberpschos, etc   the world is dense with different characters and an Exceptional narrative that beats most movies hands down.  it's like Johnny Numonic meets Robocop, mets BladeRunner meets John Wick  but heavier on constant rage and combat and exploring hundreds of more characters with an in depth minute than most movies can conquer unless in a 9 to 12 hour trilogy movie.   yup.  pretty epic.   didn't pick up \"SKIPPY\" until i had solved pretty much everything in the last play through.  couldn't stop using the AI pistol the rest of the game.  that was my go to.  \"SKIPPY\"  was the unsung hero of the game for me.   again - stellar overall narrative on tons of hard earned Fun when building your character up and meeting the expectations set forth by a Keanu Reeves led narrative world deftly crafted by CD PROJECT RED.   Epic.   Much Wow.  Take My Money.  worth playing through after solving once.   127 Hours of gaming is what i got on the last pass.  when SKIPPY\" wants to be returned to his rightful owner,  tell him you will and then just never give him back and the AI driven pistol will remain witty and crafty as he's racking up the Hits!  otherwise,  he'll bark at you to return him to Regina.  and Skippy is an epic Roll Dog.   keep that dog on the trail bringing down the Heat in world.  waaaaaay too much fun to take off the Field.",

You will still occasionally see bug but for me at least most of these seem to spring from my old hardware straining to keep up with my abuse of it. Hop into your favorite 1000 HP Mad Max looking monster and roar across the city at 200 mph and watch your computer cry as it strains to keep up with the city you are burning through. The soundtrack is amazing. Never before has a cello been so powerful in leading a battle theme as you charge into a mega corporations worth of cyborg ninjas and mechs. Standout songs include \"Resist and Disorder\", \"The Rebel Path\", and \"Not Fade Away\" \n\nTotal area wise the game space is quite a bit smaller than other open world games such as GTA 5 and the like, however very effective use is made of most of that space. Particularly in the badlands where clever layout and mission design conspire to give it a much larger feel especially when in mission. There are a few large open areas that are unused, I suppose this was to give them places to put in expansion material but I couldn't say for sure.\n\nI got this at half price but it would be money well spent even at full price. Think Deus Ex from a street level view.",

        "content": "[u]Lots of Cyber, not enough Punk.[/u]\n\n\nThis game's a tough one to review, we all know how it shipped in December of 2020. So I'll jump right into it with this: I played this after patch 1.5 and I do have mods installed (will mention it when relevant) and I will review the game accordingly.\n\nLet's start with the visuals. Aside from the blurry anti-aliasing that I masochistically kinda grew attached to by now, this game is extremely impressive. The sheer complexity of the city's layout alone turns it into an actual character of the game. The whole place screams and breathe \"future\", \"technology\" and \"society gone extreme\". All the use of neon colours and bright holograms just gives it a very vibrant nature. On top of that, the game is very loud, so many noises going off at once, cars, rockets, gunshots, wind, rain, people, advertisements, radios, the list goes on and it makes it all feel alive. \n\nSadly the feeling of aliveness stops there. The random NPCs in the city are like mannequins, they don't do much else than walking or standing there with an item in hand. Where are the routines and the complex population we were teased about? In another city, probably. \nTraffic is also terribly bad, NPCs' cars stop altogether the moment you're not driving anymore, and traffic lights automatically turn green when you're near them, it's a minor detail but once you notice it you never can unsee it.\nThe police is laughably bad at it's best, and downright pathetic at it's worst. Had to install a mod to fix it, that's how bad the experience was.  \nThe combat AI is not the best, all the enemies feel identical to each other, with little to no defining trait from a faction to another, unless they have that cyberware that go whoosh whoosh to rush at you. Only the combatants from Maelstrom and Animals behave differently from the others who are just meatbags with guns really.\nThe gameplay feels flexible but still restrict you just enough to feel like you'd need skill to get good at it. I love the fact that the guns has a very noticeable amount of recoil, often in other games they feel like lasers. Cars behave strangely, and the steering mechanic is either too low or too high, so I had to install a mod to help with that too.\nThe hacking mechanic is the highlight of the game, and for good reason, it feels extremely satisfying to build your character to be an expert netrunner that can kill anyone with just a line of sight. The environment and props are specifically thought with the netrunning mechanic taken into account and it shows.\n\nObviously, let's not forget about the bugs. They're drastically reduced now, and outside of the occasional NPC standing two feet above the ground in the middle of the road, or a car that spawns halfway into the ground, you won't see much. And the bugs you'll see aren't game breaking. Some are annoying, like the bug that removes all sound effects, or the one with the menu sound effect that keeps playing during normal gameplay. But nothing a quick save, going back to the main menu to restart the game won't fix. \n\nThe music is [b]phenomenal[/b]. The rock tracks give you old garage rock with great futuristic twists, the electronic music feels like it's coming from another planet. Sound design is top notch, cars sound great and guns do too. Voices sound crisp and deep, you sometimes really feel like they're right next to you.\n\nNow, to the story. \nLet's just say it's kind of a mixed bag. Lots of cool impressive moments, lots of incredible atmospheres and ambiences. The story itself, though, is another deal. \nAs said in the first sentence of the review, there's a lot of Cyber, which immediately makes this game strike me as a spiritual successor to Watch Dogs, but the trademark moral and political stance just isn't there at all. The neons and cyborgs all look cool, sure, but the cyberpunk genre is inherently a satire of the societies it depicts, and a true anti-capitalism/anti-corporate vector for its messages. Here, you barely mess with the corpos and when you do, it's not to hit them directly, it's just because they happen to have something you need. \n\nCurrently, I only have reached one ending so that's what I'll judge for now. The ending I had was the one where you're [i]up there.[/i] I really hated how this ending suddenly reminds itself it's part of a cyberpunk game and decides to go all self righteous when the whole game missed that specific message. \n\nThe secondary content is packed but the quality is very variable. Some quests are amazing, some take 2 minutes to complete with little to no effort. There's a lot of events scattered around the map and if you get distracted easily, you'll end up turning at 5 minutes car ride into a 40 minute adventure of violence and gritty action.\n\nNow let's go over what is by far the best aspect of the game: its characters.\nLet's start with V. V has this perfect balance of sassy and serious that makes them extremely likeable.\nJackie is probably one of the most interesting guy in the city, while he has some \"pure\" ideals like simply wanting to be financially safe and enjoying a nice bike ride, he also have a very ambitious side to him, not hesitating to take risks for his dreams, and he obviously like having a little thrill while he's at it.  \nDex is the perfect job giver, you trust his jobs are gonna pay well but deep down you know he's gonna turn his back on you any second.\nClaire is amazing with her bartender vibe, she reminds me a little of Jill from VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartender Action. She's fits well as the face of the Afterlife.\nRogue has seen some shit and it shows, she's that hard-to-earn-her-trust kinda boss, but once you get into her inner circle, you know she's got your back.\nKerry has a great character arc and is overall a very likeable guy who just kinda lost himself for a long time.\n\nAnd the elephant in the room, the one and only, Johnny Silverhand. Keanu Reeves did a stellar job with him. He's despicable, admirable, filled with anger, but has that relaxed vibe to him, he gives no fucks about anything, he's ready to do anything to further his goals, but win him over and he's gonna be your greatest ally. Just overall a larger than life character, really. Truly iconic already.\n\nSo, after all that. Is this game still worth it? Yeah, it is. But only to someone who can manage expectations. This isn't a cyberpunk GTA game, this isn't a sandbox. It's a role playing game, and a imperfect one at that. But it's still an absolute blast.",

The side quests and \"gigs\" are pretty good; Your choices matter, interaction is nice, and though combat can sometimes be repetitive, you can always just try things differently. Challenge yourself to be completely nonlethal; Stealth your way when you're mainly built for brute force; Build up your perks that stray behind because of your usual play style.\n\nYour character's build will ultimately fall one of three ways - basically either brute strength, deadly ninja, or tech wizard - based on your choice of cyberware (particularly your operating system) and attributes, but even so, nothing stops you from just picking a different approach. A generalist may not be all-powerful, but can redistribute their perk points at will. The main drawback is the level cap; You will never master all attributes at once. Pick two that are most important to you. Carefully curate the rest.\n\nLastly, say what you will about the game's strange world design or dialogue, it's pretty freakin' cool to be a tech-hacking cyber ninja with a non-lethal shotgun that shoots smart bullets targeting your enemy's kneecaps.",

The story was engaging, and there are moments that really hit hard.  The amount of unique encounters for the different player backgrounds made it worth replaying as I was interested to see how the street kid would react as opposed to the corpo or the nomad.  Eagerly awaiting the DLC and hoping more people will be open minded about this.",

Advertizing this as an open world experience is still, even in 2022, a total scam. \n\nHonestly, I don't know how CDPR is going to recover from this, and I seriously doubt they will. It seems a lot like this will always be the sh*tstain on their otherwise white vest.\nIt's a shame, but hopefully it'll be a lesson to other studios as to what not to do and how not to monetize a flawless reputation into a dogsh*t looking cuckfest",

If you enjoy games for the immersion, and can easy throw yourself into any story, regardless of the quality of the game, this is for you.

I will replay it again, so that will be 450 hours.\n\nTL;DR: 2077 doesn't have the replayability or mod support of a Bethesda game, and is not as fun of an open world and lacks multiplayer compared to a Rockstar game. \n\nThe game ends and there is no end game. There is no reason to jump back into Night City after you clear the map and complete the main story line unless you are starting over, which will probably be old after my third playthrough.\n\nWith FO4 and Skyrim, there is an endless stream of new content and gameplay changes thanks to good mod support. I've never actually hit every point of interest in any one of my playthroughs of these games. Cells respawn, and there are the maligned Radiant quests (but hey, at least there is something). \n\nWith GTA V and RDR2, the open world can still be fun after you beat the main story. Plenty of good times to be had just blowing stuff up and killing cops. Unlike 2077, it's a lot more challenging to 100% the map or get gold on all of the missions. Not to mention the beast which is GTA V online.\n\nAnyways... I hope the modding scene for this game blows up, and I hope CDPR adds multiplayer or some kind of challenging end-game component because the action is actually fun and the game looks great. It has potential.",

It's sad, that thanks to some people, developers had to publish this game earlier.

        "content": "This is probably my favourite game since CS:GO, Skyrim and Civ 5 sucked me in all those years ago. I've played through the game a few times, got most of everything done and keep wanting to come back for more. I LOVE this game, it just sucks me in and I can't leave until I've romanced Judy again and rode off into the sunset with Panam.\n\nThe game looks amazing, feels great to play, the progression and levelling system feels good, the music is incredible, Keanu Reeves is incredible, the main story is super engaging and many of the side quests are great too. I am a sucker for cyberpunk as a genre and now definitely want to give the TTRPG as well as Shadowrun a go too.\n\nThough there's still some bugs present, including weird vehicle physics, occasional T-Posing and some HUD disappearing acts, the game is generally pretty polished and up to snuff. It is now as it should have been on release gameplay-wise.\n\nThere could, and should, now be updates that make infinite playability and replayability feasible with things like RNG Fixer gigs, with lots of space for expansions, for example in Pacifica, as well as more accessible verticality. I would also love for there to be expansions that, well, expand on the ending choices, giving us a little context for what happens next, as well as expanding on some of the relationship choices and potentially giving us access to more big jobs to take part in.\n\nIf the rumours I have seen are true though, that doesn't look likely to happen with CDPR switching to Unreal Engine and a supposed recording confirming only one expansion, coming in 2023. I really hope this isn't the case as the game is definitely in a good place now, and could really thrive with some expansions and support over the next few years. If CDPR decide to abandon this game it would be a real shame, but I hope they pull a No Man's Sky and redeem the reputation of CP2077 and I'm hopeful for a sequel once production for The Witcher 4 is complete as there's massive potential for the world of Cyperpunk.\n\nLong story short, if you've been on the fence about the game, like the genre and/or want a solid story in a visually stunning world, definitely give it a shot, I can't recommend the game enough, though you might want to wait for a sale. HOWEVER, if you are expecting a finished, polished experience at AAA price, and, understandably, can't appreciate what is there past the botched launch, still present bugs and general lack of finish beyond the main quests and bigger side quests, I'd give it a miss, unless it's on sale for a good price.\n\nI really hope CDPR don't abandon the game and consider a sequel in the future. I love the setting, love the atmosphere, love the music, love the story, it's just 80% of the way to where it should have been. Stop the crunch, announce games when they're ready next time.",

The gameplay is fun, though lacking in variety & depth, No Flying vehicles, no Amphibious vehicles, no air combat, no amphibious combat, less depth blunt weapons combat, no Vehicle Customization, less gun customization, & little things to do other than combat & collectathon.  But for what it has it is fun nonetheless, how much more if added those missing or disregarded features & contents.\n\nAll in all, the game is atmospheric & immerses me as a player in an idea of Futuristic city from the 80's 90's perspective whilst providing a Wonderful Story & world to sniff through. \n\nI rate it an 7.8 out of 10. 9 or 10 if those missing or disregarded features & content are added in an upcoming update/expansion.",

I'm still waiting for the vehicle AI that was shown off to us 4 years ago in the 2018 promotional material, the writing and choices that were promised pre-release, the features that were promised to us over and over for years and were never delivered. We certainly got *a* game in 2020, but it was not the 2077 we were promised, and now it appears CDPR has given themselves a pat on the back and are calling it 'good enough'. Hopefully they release a devkit for RED Engine so that modders can make this the game it was supposed to be.",

Now, there is one thing I have purposefully left out until this point. Johnny. Silverhand. Voiced by Keanu Reeve. His performance as a badass hero, trying to take over an evil corporation is as if you are playing an action movie (Which you are). \n\n\nAll in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is the best experience you will have if you buy it.",

Still managed to have fun (even with the game running at roughly 25-30 fps with a few dips as low as 20 fps). I wouldn't recommend this game on a PC that was purchased around the release of the PS4 & Xbox One, however on a PC that at least beats the Recommended Specs, i could see this game being a fantastic experience.\n\n[b] Important Tip: Make use of the Benchmarking tool that is built in. It was very helpful in getting a general sense of how well the game would run using different settings. [/b]",

There are good aspects like the writing which is at time time a joy just to watch characters interacting with each other or to you. A good third of the side quest are good, another third is just you killing targets, and the last third range from mid to bad. The driving feels very slippery and when you call a car or bike to you it just spawns 50-40 meters away and starts to drive to you. Some features are useless like the more in depth character creator or the crafting system. There are times where I feel that my choices don't matter unless it was in a story related scene.

        "content": "This game is absolutely incredible! although It was released in a rather poor state (even on PC), you can't take away the fact that this is the kind of game you will play once in a decade. Characters, Story, World detail, are all top notch. The fun factor of the gameplay-loop FAR exceeds anything found in The Witcher 3. After playing through the whole game I came out extremely satisfied with main story, but at the same time I just want Cyberpunk to continue! It's such an amazing world. I still hope we will see many DLCs that will fill this expansive universe with even more detail and content.\n\nOne thing I have noticed is that many players don't understand what kind of game Cyberpunk 2077 is. Many seem to play the game as a sandbox GTA game, however I found much more similarities with an immersive sims, where player expression is key to the whole experience, and Cyberpunk delivers in that regard. You can take on missions in many different ways/styles depending on the character build and how you approach missions, and you are rewarded handsomely if your talk to people in missions, read logs, messages as well as the lore about the different areas, gangs, characters etc. (which are displayed as \"cards\" in the journal menu for each mission). However, by doing so, I JUST WANT MORE! You might feel underwhelmed, like you haven't been able to explore the world completely after the end credits roll. But I really think that has to do with how big and detailed the world is. It took me ~90 hours to complete the game and you can't really squeeze more gameplay out of a AAA production than that. But the world is there to facilitate so much more content. So many more stories to tell\n\nSo please CDPR, don't abandon this game. It is a homerun, a 10/10 in my book. (which doesn't mean \"perfect\", but rather \"as good as they come\")",

Some bugs still be, has come a long way! \n\nWas there on the launch day, buggy gameplay, incredibly lacking features, immense disappointment. But after a year and a half (and a massive update), decided to give it a try. It's an incredible experience. \n\nThe side quests all feel alive, it's not a nameless settlement/person needing your help. Each one typically begins with actual call from someone, giving backstory and motivation to help them, or the people involved. \n\nEach \"gig\" builds on the world, either through re-occuring characters that you'll meet throughout the game, or dropping a little bit of lore in dialogue or terminal readings. \n\nThe story and characters are all fairly amazing, and, for the most part, are voiced fairly well. The gunplay is fun, though the game suffers from a classic leveling system of characters and weapons. You might come across a side-mission that is way above your level, and get one-shot immediately. So you'll have to be mindful of how you approach things, and watch your DPS. \n\nWhat we didn't enjoy, however, was the lack of dialogue that seemed to be missing. Like Grand Theft Auto V, you will get into vehicles and talk with people on the way to destinations. The difference being that Cyberpunk does not build on those moments like GTA V, which will sometimes have you parked outside of the objective so you can listen to the rest of the dialogue play out. \n\nInstead, Cyberpunk conversations last only for a few moments, very very rarely lasting the entire trip. The game will give you an option to skip the rest of the ride when the dialogue is over. This is unfortunate, as the game has hella lore about the world at every corner. But really hides the backstories of the characters you work with to key moments, rather than casual small-talk. \n\nOverall:\n\nCyberpunk is BIG fun, and you should definitely give it a try!",

I'ts not the next gen game that was promise. GTA 4 has better AI than this. The NPC's are just ridiculous.The story seems kind of interesting but my progress has been slow due to bugs and crashes. I did do update my drivers regularly and that did help with the a lot of bugs but even the little ones get annoying after a while. If you want the game I would recommend buying it on sale. When it's $30 or less. I'ts a shame that a lot of games these days are released unfinished and broken.\nUPDATE: I've been working on this game for some time. They did update many of the glitches away. I plays much better than it did a couple months ago. For me, this doesn't help. Anyways the story is ok but feels very generic. NPC's are like playing GTA 2. Don't buy it full price. buy it on a sale.",

The tedium sets in when you start trying to clear the map of all the alerts and minor encounters, so as a completionist sort of gamer you're going to have a couple hours of great content followed by a couple hours of slogging through gangoons on the streets and then back to another story mission. Weapon variety and crafting work fine. Driving is fine. Tempting to fast travel everywhere to save time, but if you want to get your athletics skill up you have to run and climb everywhere, that sort of thing. Really free-form game to play, where you can walk in and shoot everybody, or plan it out and hack the cams first and infect their network before going to ninja/stealth game play. Worth at least one play through.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk has it's roots so far up so many nerds butt's (as does Witcher 3) it would be impossible to make such a massive game and not get over-hyped and have the product under perform. I was on the hype train. I couldn't get enough material to watch and read, and most of what I was seeing kept me excited. I had trust in CDPR, as well as the massive and talented team they built for this production.\n\nWhen I booted the game up finally (after several delays), I knew the game, regardless of how polished it was, was a contender to become one of the best and most engaging RPGs to date. Right away you're put into an incredibly detailed and beautiful render of a cyberpunk metropolis. *High Tech, Low Life* They nailed the aesthetic of this game in every way. And they nailed the music and sound design as well. On a production level, I am truly blown away. Night City has to be one of the best looking open worlds ever created. \n\nI got the game at release, and played through a decent amount of side quests, but I really wanted to experience the main story line without too much distraction. I thought the main story line was solid, and it's clear there is a ton of side questing to get done if you want to stick around Night City. It did, however, feel strange to stop at the last quest before the end of the main line, just to keep playing that character longer. It's one of those 'no turning back' quests, and I wasn't sure about the new game + content, so I kept that last quest hanging for a bit as I did a bunch of other side questing. I had fun.\n\n{EDIT as of patch at 6/7/22: The crowd system and traffic have been overhauled. It's not perfect, but it's better than the below statements} Now, unfortunately, I am a gamer that really pays attention to the matrix of a game let's say. I work in game development myself, and I really pay close attention to the finer details of what's under the hood. This is where the game let me down. For all the beauty, so many things are skin deep. When I play a game this immersive with such a high fidelity, there are things you expect. I expect a crowd system that works. I expect a crowd that is diverse, doesn't repeat noticeably, and stays it's course when I turn around. I mean, I won't even hold it against CDPR for not making each and every pedestrian 'have a life of their own', and tasks to carry out--which I believe was touted early in a development interview. But I do expect a solid system that doesn't cull the NPCs out willy nilly. You can catch it quite easily. I think they just gave up the crowd system and said screw it. As beautiful as it is skin deep, it is quite repetitive and broken. \n\nAs is the police system--one of my most disliked features of this game. To me it feels absolutely necessary with the level of immersion and world-building this game boasts, to have a fleshed-out police system. Do something appropriately illegal in this game, and the cops will just spawn right behind you and start shouting and shooting. It's ludicrous this unfinished system was allowed in the gold version of the game. If I had my druthers I would have had an additional delay to simply input this system fully. GTA has been doing it pretty well for a very long time now. Why can't this game have it? Makes no sense, I'm vexed, and I want to forget about it. Also, while we are on the topic of systems in the game, the traffic system was shallow and broken as well. Another fault I didn't understand being allowed to sit at gold. At surface level it was fine, but pay attention, and the AI is oblivious.\n\nAside from those immersion breaking bugs, I still had a really sweet time cruising Night City. I'm running a system based around a 2070, and I was able to play it with DLSS on High raytrace, and get decent FPS. It was really quick to change from raytraced to not, so often when I was walking around just exploring, I'd set raytraced on and go. If there was a fight or a driving quest, I'd turn RT off. Pretty quick and easy, and I'd gain like 20fps. I'm sure systems running 3090's are going to be loving how well everything runs and looks.\n\nIf you are at all a fan of William Gibson, Phillip K Dick, Mike Pondsmith, Blade Runner, or any number of sci fi films through the 80s and 90s, you're going to enjoy this game.\n\nAfter watching a fantastic Cyberpunk doc on YT, I'm back installing giving it another go. It's been a hot minute, so let's see what they have in store. \n\nUpdated review as of 11/10/22\n\nI think the new patches have been fantastic, and the game is looking, running, and playing much better than it's earlier stages. I still think it can grow and improve. I think Night City is an absolute must keep for future content. I want to see more doors open up and more quests. I want more more more. It's one of the most beautifully rendered CG environments ever created. I'm bumping up my score to 8 or 10 (used to be 7 of 10). \n\n8 of 10",

I really enjoyed the main story line with Johnny(Keeanu), it almost feels like a block buster sci fi movie at times. \n\nIronically, games like this always fall short on a few notes. Character customization visually is pretty limited. The cyberware upgrades are very lackluster. For reference, upgrading your \"Augments\" in Deus Ex was more fun, more interesting and more fundamental to the gameplay in that game. Cyberpunk seems to fall into the \"all audiences\" category at least when it comes to gameplay. Everything else is without a doubt, \"Adult\" LOL. \n\nThis game is extremely fun to play, which made things a huge disapointment when I finished the main storyline, and side quests, which I was expecting to be more of in such a \"huge\" open world game. But when you get down to the brass taxes, the game is pretty shallow in comparison to how big it is. I maxed out my character in \"Street Cred\" and no longer receive missions like \"gigs\" and \"jobs\". Its so ironic, that game devs make a game so big, and so grand and bla bla bla, only to halt you as the player from continuing to enjoy the game they worked so hard to create. \n\nIn summary, If you get this on a sale, and you know for a fact that your System can run it smoothly on at least medium settings it's definitely worth it. The Cyberpunk world is very well done, soundtrack is awesome, the story will draw you in and the gameplay will keep you coming back for more.",

It isn't exactly a AAA experience (more like A and a half), but it isn't horrible like many make it out to be; it's a good RPG set in a pretty fulfilling open world, with decent gameplay and good graphics. The story isn't half bad, although Johnny Silverhand's character is a bit.. lopsided? In one cutscene he'll like you, then in the next V will mention that he's kind of a dick. It's very inconsistent, and fairly messy. The open world is a lot like this, too - cars will spawn on top of you while driving down the highway, and you'll encounter the exact same NPC walking down the same road at least 5 times in one walk. All this being said, the gameplay itself is very fun and nicely rewarding, especially once you unlock the double jump. The team has also made many improvements and changes to how certain stats work, which has greatly improved the game. \nTL;DR: While the game is good, wait for a sale. Do your research and determine if you'll have fun with a buggy (yet fun!) mess of a game that is Cyberpunk 2077.",

I had no attachments to Keanu, have still never seen the Matrix, so the hype went right over my head as did the screwed up launch. I knew nothing about the game, okay? At first, buggy launches and not playing with my controller right irked me in all the wrong ways. Once I finally got it working, though...\n\nI hated it.  The mechanics confused my slow lizard brain.  I flatlined more times than I have in real life. Then I figured out how things worked... and suddenly I'm obsessed with this well-crafted, albeit flawed game.  Suddenly, it's two am and I've been reading shards for the lore for the past hour, wiki up on my other monitor. I have 500 hours and counting, have done every gig, every NCPD side gig, and three different endings, one being the secret ending.  I'm excited to see what they'll do with story expansions given how varied the endings are. I loved the characters for the most part and was sad when I had exhausted things to do with them.  There's one particular set of missions I replayed a good dozen times trying to save a certain character from certain doom. I need a prequel of Johnny's life during the Mexican conflict, a spin off with Yorinobu, and another three story expansions all preferably before 2077. \n\nTl;dr:\nJohnny T-posed for dominance in Arasaka, 20/10\nBuy this game or rogue AI will consume your soul.",

It was released with a lot of bugs... which they have devoted themselves to patching ever since. In addition, they've been updating and improving, adding things that other game companies would have sold separately as DLC. That being said...\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is possibly one of the best games I have ever played. For those wanting a fair description, imagine a combination of Witcher 3, Grand Theft Auto, and Arkham Knight. The open world setting is massive, and disturbingly realistic. The characters are genuinely interesting and the voice acting is superb. The gameplay itself is fun and engaging (especially now that the bugs have been worked out). This game is VERY much worth getting, particularly on sale.",

Doesnt run well, but my pc hardly meets the minimum, theres alot of games that i cant run so i cant speak to optimization, though my framerates are definitely better than launch. They keep updating this game and adding free content, something thats rare these days so thats refreshing. I think the devs really do care about this game and it shows. Give it a try, if nothing else you wont go bored.",

Highly recommended since I have managed to play out so many times now. Incredible for a city they have created and if you have a powerful video card, you almost live in Night City.\nLooking forward to when the Phanton Liberty dlc and possibly some new cyberpunk game comes out! :D Very happy with this game. 10/10",

Many Youtube videos showed just what to look for, and i'm pleased to say i just don't see any thing that would tell me this is not the best open-world game made to date. The day to day MPC movements could use more work, but all and all they look like people going about their day(really need more varied dialogue responses tho) and make the city feel alive to a great degree.\nMy fondest hope for this game is expansion after the main story is complete, I've seen pretty much all the story from Youtube because i just didn't want to spend $60 for a game not finished (bug free), so i would love for a few more hours of story, maybe the space station? idk just something a bit more from the best DEV's in the biz.

        "content": "As a person who loves the concept of cyberpunk, from the atmosphere and world, the lives that we infer they may live, to the violence as money takes hold of more and more people, I think this game brings a lot of that together. During launch day it was definitely a flop. There were many bugs; game breaking, the graphics weren't optimized, and it was very obvious that, this game was released in pressure from the community. However, as the years have passed, there have been many changes. The bugs no longer interfere with the game as heavily as they did before, the graphics have been updated, guns and items polished up, vehicles mechanics, driving, npc behaviours, and much more that you can only really feel while playing this game. Now I won't sugar coat it, it's  not what it was intended to be pre-release, but its a game thats still worth playing. Now this may be a biased review, but I will put both the pros and cons I see from this game. \n\nPros:\nAtmosphere..\nIt's beautiful. You may be thinking to yourself, is it really beautiful from what many people have said where there are headless npcs. Yes, of course, that's the best part. Jokes aside it truly is. I've ran about 80 hours into the game, and I can tell you, I don't think I can bored of the city. If you wanted to play a game, which brought the future infront of you, and made it realisitc. This is definitely it. As you drive around the city going from gig to gig, you will feel it. You feel the changes in districts, you feel the changes in atmosphere, the lives of the npcs, the buildings that surround you, even the parts that lay inside the buildings. They way you hear the news buzzing around you, telling you about the corrupt world that refuses to change. The way the npcs talk about trying to get out of their rough lives, thinking that maybe they've finally found a way out. The quite empty roads, to the gunshots in the distance, to gangs picking on innocent people; as the neon lights truly fill the street. The immersion is one that's truly taken from granted, and as you finally leave the grasps of the city, you can feel the quite hmm of the badlands, still crawling with action, and a thirst to find a way out. \n\nStoryline.. \nEach character you can truly feel. This game has been awarded story-rich for a reason. That's what it was made for. For you to get the feel, as a person working in corporate. Or starting out from the dumps, as you progress the story you feel every bit of the city. From the people you interact with, and people you change paths with, you grow more and more attached, wanting to spend more time, learn more, as to how did they start off; how it's so different for every character you meet, and how they got to where they are now in this buzzing city. You yourself, as you travel, fight, discover, explore, you can feel your own character grow, and your own sense of self blends into the choices you make throughout the game, and maybe how you would be in this world if you lived here. It truly is beautiful, and only something you can grasp when playing this game.\n\nCons:\nNow there are always pros, and there are always cons, some games have more than others. I think cyberpunk, has its cons, its not the worlds greatest game, but it's not something that doesn't make the game not worth it. \n\nBUGS... :_)\nYes yes, bugs are there, they have been there from the start. BUT NO, they aren't game breaking. CDPR has got, a lot, and I mean a lot of backlash for the buggy game they released back in 2020. However, I can say this much. Their game, is still, in my opinion, perhaps one of the greatest games ever made. They have spent, a lot, and I mean A LOT, of time fixing these bugs. From yes, the headless npcs, to you being chased by T-posing mobs, to even your car flying from a hit from, who knows what. It's been handled very well. You still encounter bugs, like for my case there have been times where the perspective was stuck in story mode while actually playing the game, which was fixed just by me going to main screen and coming back. As well as me driving really fast into yellow barricades, and them getting stuck in my car, which would send me for an inception time flying experience, which was actually a nice refresher seeing something so silly. It wouldn't stop me from playing the game, or have me miss out on something important. It still kept me going, and gave me a good laugh here and there. The bugs in this game are very subjective. If you are the type of person who's gonna bawl over a bug you found and never play the game again, thennnn... maybe you shouldn't get it, but if you aren't like that and don't mind your car flying every once in a while, and can even get a good laugh from it, this game will definitely give that you. The bugs are there, always have been, and always will be, but they don't outweigh the other aspects of the game, still making it worth your money.\n\nStoryline..?? \nYes, I talked a lot about how this story line was beautiful, and it is, my only problem with it, is that it's too short. There are plenty of side gigs and fun people to meet, explore, and things to do, but the main storyline is short, and that's one thing I definitely wished was longer. CDPR is adding expansions and it's been rumoured that we will be getting more things to do while we wait for the expansion, but it's still short. Side missions can last from 5 minutes to anywhere around 30. I'm still playing the game and have more stuff to do, but the more I play the more I enjoy how well this game as been made. As for CDPR, they've done great, not what was promised, but none the less respectable. \n\nConclusion:\nIn my opinion, this game has improved a lot since it's release, and will continue to improve in small ways making the game more fun. As for expansion many players still wait to see what will happen with that, as well as future updates. But the current stage the game is in, it's beautiful, and worth trying. However, my only thing is that I would recommend getting it on sale. Is it worth the whole $80? Maybe not, is it worth 40 tho? 100%. And as long as you are enthusiastic about the world, the concept, of cyberpunk, you will come to love the game and what it has to offer. However, if you are playing for it to have the same level of depth as elden ring, choose elden ring. IT definitely is, something different, and something truly worth appreciating. \n\nIf you decide to get this game, have fun playing. Chooms :D",

The game has a handful of bugs related to how things spawn, but it hasn't really affected my gameplay.\n\nThe voice acting is impeccable, and all the motion - from cars, to pedestrians, to facial expressions and gestures during conversation - is quite enjoyable, aside from occasional clipping. The world initially feels natural, rich and varied.\n\nBut after a time, the game feels fairly hollow. Nearly all secondary quests fall into 3 categories - sneaking past everyone, incapacitating everyone, or killing everyone, and they all begin to feel the same unless you are following the details conveyed in the written text of \"shards\" (CP2077's equivalent of books).\n\nTertiary situations and exploration are basically pointless grinds just to buff your character in preparation for your main questline. The rich appearance of the city fosters a curiosity to explore that is almost never satisfied, as quite literally 99% of the buildings have nothing to discover, and, save for a few main-quest buildings, the few entrances that can be found offer no uniqueness or reason to return to them.",

Even if not every idea in it is the most incredibly original, it explores ideas hypercapitalist efforts to market and own the soul and gives you the chance to take a brick to the system, and I can't imagine anything more cyberpunk than that. Multiple endings based on your choices, including a pretty awesome secret ending. Some fave criticized the 80s cyberpunk aesthetic, but I pretty staunchly defend it. Not only is it cool, but I think it speaks to the zeitgeist of the 80s, this inflection point of decisions society made in that decade that sent us on our current trajectory toward an increasingly real cyberpunk reality.\n\nAlso the game is pretty darn fun, looks gorgeous, and the bugs of launch are more or less patched out by now. Soundtrack is superb, really great cinematic feel to the gameplay, awesome characters that stick with you. Still waiting on some promised features, but the modding community has added many of those back in to some degree or other (more challenging netrunner enemies, vehicle combat, improved vehicle handling, street vendors, the metro, etc.). One of my all-time favorites.",

Don't even really want to call it a game, I felt like I was living a second life for the few weeks I was playing this and that made the ending hit super hard.\nI could write an entire essay on some of the things that make this so good but there isn't enough room in these review boxes.\n\nDo not listen to the negative critics on this, it played perfectly on my PC, I saw like maybe 1 glitch the entire nearly 80 hours.\n\nThis game is easily the most immersive non-VR game I've ever played and the characters and among the best ever designed, very nearly up there with Mass Effect honestly.",

I've already put 100 hrs into it and I'm only on my second play through, there are so many options and different lines to choose from making the main story great to play not to mention three different lifestyles to choose from and you get to choose to play male V or Female V. At the very least you can play 6 different times yet each time doesn't have/need to be played the same. This game to me is a very strong 10/10 even with it's bugs.",

Being a bit late to the party, I haven't experienced basically any of those bugs people reported initially, and the few ones I had (mostly UI related) got reset with a simple quick save/quick load.

Sure its got cool moments here and there, many AAA games are on launch we can't discredit that just because we waited a long time for a game as shallow and buggy as this one. But at its core, it knows what it wants to be, and doesn't manage to be it.\n\nSince its launch ive dumped 10 hours into the game and haven't had a moment where I felt my experience was absolutely ruined by T-posing guards and poorly synced lips. I just...let my experience be ruined by how shallow the game was. Took advantage of the burly heavily armored guard from behind as he asserted his dominance over his chair with a certain vibrating mace of consent from behind, then realized I was the guy and CDPR had the mace.\n\nUltimately, there will be people who only see the best in the things they enjoy. I decided to make the best of the worst and enjoy it for what it is, but I'm actually criticizing its many weak points. If your only gripe is that there's no salon, you've got no excuse to not be playing worms.",

From interesting side characters to amazing main characters every interaction, combined with the performances, makes you more and more drawn to everyone you interact with. I don't think there was a single character by end game that I disliked. Each brings their own unique personality and feel real! It may have been a mess at the beginning but I'm telling you that you would be missing out if you didn't play it now. The dev team really overhauled the game with the 1.5 update and have proven again and again that they want this game to succeed. This game was made with love and passion, and it shows.",

The bond with different characters holds up against any RPG game.  Its a sprawling city with plenty of easter eggs and side quests (some great ones for sure) to see.   If you like creating a character and immersing yourself in a game then youll love this just fine. npcs arent really doing much but the npcs you actually need to talk to are fleshed out great.  I have like 600 hours in on this game and I still have a hard time not wanting to get back in and play a different role with my own head cannon.  The soundtrack for themes and final ending tugs at the emotions not to mention i laugh a lot \"yup, just a couple of f**king Looozers\" haha.  Its worth the money and now that they fixed it , much more immersive (homes, clothes, gigs).  9.5/10   Npcs acting like red dead redem 2 would of made this a 10 for me but still amazing game",

Does it feel worth it? Does it feel like the game play leading up to that final moment was worthwhile? If yes, then move to the next criteria.\n2. Do I feel the need to listen to the Star Wars Ending Theme during or after the credits? Was the game so moving that I can express no other joy as to having been through that experience than to play such an amazing track? If yes, the game has achieved masterpiece status.\n\nI started playing this game during my exams and it was something to behold. It was still broken and glitchy as hell. There was not a single session that I didn't fall through the map while driving. But if you look past it's technical flaws, and think of them as part of it's charm, this game was an experience. During my first playthrough I was tempted to 100% it. And I came damn near close. The world was bright, big, and expansive. The story was spectacular, with deep and heartfelt characters. There was an amount of zany chaos, balanced out by tough decisions that actually mattered. There was not one area of this game that I thought was lacking. I am stunned at just how much I love this game. And my favourite aspect is that you aren't a God in this game. You're just some dude (or chick!) and life ain't bowing down to you. You ain't the chosen one, or some divine being. You are you, trying to get through life on the streets without dying. It felt oddly grounded for a game set in such a strange fantastical world. Though I need a break now, I look forward to replaying it in the future. THIS is my personal Best Game of 2022. My only question moving forwards is: When can I have more?\n\nTL;DR: It's broken and glitchy. I love it. You might too. Easily my top game of 2022.",

        "content": "Edit: \n\nAfter about 45 hours, the buggy programming came back. This game is still fucked up with tons of immersion breaking bugs. Cars being stuck halfway in the ground, driving around. NPC's stuck in the ground, walking around and talking to you with only the top half of their body visible. NPC's walking in the middle of road, stuck in the air, holding up traffic. Interacting with objects on a table or box could send nearby stuff flying all over the place. The weird thing though is that it seems to be mission specific, and pertaining to the mid-late stages of the main story line in particular. \n\nThe cyberpunk style is really cool. The armor/clothing bring a lot of sexy flair with the chrome, latex, leather outfits you can put together. The side-gigs are engaging with lots of story and cinematics and so is the combat. Infiltrating a compound and single handily clearing a place is fun with ninjitsu/hacking skills. Combat with cyberpsychos can be interesting and fun.\n\nThis game is a lot of fun now. After they've done a lot of fine-tuning and polishing, they've found a unique game play signature that's can be defined as a simplified & stream-lined Fallout/Skyrim in terms of crafting, combat and story-telling + GTA-styled driving around. A lot of cars have been added to the game world. Weapon mods have been slightly improved, which makes fighting with them cooler. Hacking has been improved and there's a lot of places where you can use hacking at now. The different class perks really come together now too; such as body for health regen, cool for stealthing, technical for hacking, reflexes for weapons. Previously I said it was boring but this game is a lot of fun now. Only after playing for about 35 hours did I find one of those immersion breaking bugs that are so annoying that it takes your mind out of the story and becomes the only thing you can focus on. I haven't encountered any CTD's except for when I was rewinding a BD with my FPS set to 120 but maybe it's just because my computer isn't that great but I do play on Ultra with everything set to max. \n\nI'd rate it in the high 90% range.\n\n\n*PREVIOUS REVIEW *\n\nI *barely* recommend it because the real-time combat and story sequences are fun and engaging. \n\nThey put too much effort into things they shouldn't have and not enough effort into things they should have. \n\nThey should've kept it simple and just focused on giving a solid, fun game play and cinematic story. \n\nBD's (brain dances) are lame story sequences where you have to find clues so the story can be revealed. It's kind of like trying to find your socks before you can go out and play. A lot of boring hunting and searching but you wish you could hurry it up so you can get back to the good part.\n\nHacking reminds me of Watch Dogs, but lamer, and they aren't all that fun or all that useful, which allows you to sneak up on enemies who are caught unaware or temporarily disable cameras. Sneaking up behind people to kill or knock them out is simplistic because enemy AI is about as aware as sloths. NPC's you're travelling with always alert you when they're near, which is like every room you enter, which is annoying. It's not integrated very well and you can sidestep the whole hacking/sneaking portion of game play if you wish and just go into a mission by throwing grenades, with guns-a-blazin'. \n\nIt's a giant sandbox where you can go anywhere and do what you want. You can own cars and drive them yourself. Driving feels like Grand Theft Auto and is mostly lame. it's not a very interesting element of the game that costs you money if you drive poorly. I'd just turn auto-drive on and forget about it. There should be more fast travel points. \n\nCharacter creation is a nice feature and nicely done in this game but why did they even put it in if you can't see your character during the important story points? Only their hands are visible. Only time you can see your character is when they're looking in the mirror so 95% of the time, the character creation is pointless.\n\nThere's no auto loot and a ton of pointless minutiae to pick up in every room. It ruins the overall experience having to worry about pointless junk you need to pick up so you can disassemble or sell them later. \n\nI heard there's addons you can get for this game to change some features but I don't like messing around with addons. For one, you can't really trust them. For another, I think a developer that relies on 3rd-party developers to create creature comfort features are counting on the (free) community's hard work to help polish their game. It isn't right. \n\nThe core product should be polished and in the best, most immersive, most balanced experience when it's put up for sale. It's a personal preference but there's a ton of great games out there that don't use 3rd-party addons *at all*.\n\nThis game is 55% cool and fun; and 45% pointless and boring.",

I still look in awe at how beautiful the graphics are in this game. The expressions on characters faces, to the amazing lighting. \n\nStory- I could not stop playing this game, I will likely go through it a few more times just because its so damn good. \n\nCombat- Play this game on hard at least! The combat is great, enemies are tough and you can die easily. It makes for a great challenge, and a fun one!\n\nSound- Also amazing. \n\nThis is a game I felt the excitement with that I have not found in many games to date. \n\nFingers crossed they bring it further along with some DLC.\n\nI would 100% pay full price for this game, its that damn good.

I mean, yeah you can up-level thru crafting, but ugh.... crafting is such a lame thing skill to upgrade because the perks aren't that good. it doesn't tempt me.

Driving cars kind of sucks, but motorcycles are just fine. \n\nThe primary characters are well written. Typical from CD Projekt Red, IMO.\n\nOverall, in 2022, I would absolutely recommend this game.

I'm playing on the PC with patch 1.52.\n    For the first couple of hours, my initial reaction was \"what the f**k is going on here?\". The graphics are good, but so far I'm not real impressed by the music score. Maybe that will change as I get farther into the game. I do like the interactions which go on between your character and other characters, like when I sat down beside Misty and was talking to her, or laying with Skype in \"automatic love\". It makes the game seem more real. I also like how some of the dialog choices you make have real consequences. I'm used to playing MMOs where most times the choices you make are irrelevant. \n   Now some quirks I've noticed: The first street thug I attacked 'bounced back' several feet after I made a few shots. I've seen people walk through crates. So far only seen one person do a T pose on me :-). I think it is funny when I call my motorcycle and it pulls up and stops right in the middle of the road! You would think they would have it pull to the side of the road. Had to laugh one time my bike pulled up and mowed over someone crossing the street! I've read many people don't like the driving, but I have fun driving down the road, and try to act as if I was driving in real traffic. I haven't tried this yet, but I'm guessing driving would be easier to control using a gamepad and not the keyboard.\n   So to wrap up for now, this is an interesting game to play and do look forward to getting back into it each day.\n",

Cyberpunk 2077 is still just a rusty car with a fresh coat of paint, a heap of dog s**t spritzed with perfume.\"[/i]\n\nYeah? Well not anymore!

The world would look a whole lot differently for the future of CD Projekt.\n\nSadly it feels a bit empty after a little while, so many interiors you can't enter, so many areas just greebled and not a lot of development or content creation. *If* what they sold us on, they ever actually deliver, why, this [i]could be[/i] one of the best games in the history of computer gaming, even though it's not original - not at all, and it's not a very good representation of the Cyberpunk universe either. And then they stuck a lame driving sim on top of an adventure/shooter RPG. Just --- [i]whaaaat?[/i]\n\nI know they've committed to \"fixing\" it, and we do expect some of it, but it's over a year on and the damage is done. And we know we're not getting what we expected, we just won't at this point, the odds it'll get even more side gigs is iffy to me, content creation costs money, and we know they lost a lot of it! I expect we'll have some paid expansions soon enough.\n\n([i]another game we were promised a huge expanse of nested multi-choice / shades-of-gray and the whole game comes down to just a couple yes-or-no choices, very similar to what Obsidian and \"The Outer Worlds\" did to us. - I trust no one anymore, you eff'ing corporat liars in marketing can all get flatlined by faulty Mr Stud penetration for all we care. \n\nPS: That's sarcasm, I don't wish harm on anyone. I know you guys get actual threats, and I am sorry about that and hope they're just threats of frustrated people who lost money investing in you. Maybe don't lie so much to falsely inflate your sales and customer/investor expectations?[/i])\n\nAm I bitter? Yes I am.

Death, the one\ncertainty in this universe of chaos, can be both a tragic end and a release from\nsuffering. It can come as an unexpected twist, or as a beautiful, crowning\ncounterpart to a life well-lived.\n\nThe curse we have as humanity, the only living beings in constant awareness of\ndeath, is out inordinate focus on the fact. How much happier is the life of the\ngazelle that escapes the cheetah's clutches, thinking that it evaded death once\nand for all, than the poor soul living out his days knowing each step inches him\ncloser to the void![/i]",

Street kid start plus will do as female V.   I may or may not start adding in Mods but I think will do that after another bread and as a 4th run through.   Yes, enjoyed that much... will see how I feel with the 3rd run before deciding on a break before modding the crap out of this game.\n\nI bought and started playing just before 1.5 patch happened so i didn't really run into issues that happened at launch.  My first play through was a rush to the end of the story line (did virtually no side stuff).  Now I am playing a second time and avoiding the main story line as much as possible... still some quirky ?issues? with some of the environment and NPCs but I am really loving the game... I was looking for something simiar to Deus Ex (ABSOLUTELY LOVED)  This is very different but still in the same vein.  Loving this Game now as well",

The games not perfect and theres QOL stuff that would make the game much better but over all the story, setting, and characters you come across are great. The enemy AI is okay and leaves me with a feeling of wanting something more. The world looks full of people walking around the city and shops but the level of immersion with the NPC's around the world just doesn't seem there most of the time and they're just there to make the world look full. The variety of different melee weapons and guns is pretty good and the variety of cloths is good too(as of posting this theres no transmog system in place so its either looks or stats) I would recommend a playthrough if you are interested it is a fun/good game.",

The update really made a big difference in the game for me, especially since it let me sort out the interesting questlines from the ubisoft style quests. The story really is phenomenal and is what makes the game. However, this is its greatest weakness. Replaying the game is stunted by having to go through the story every time, which sounds like it should be a good thing but after a while, it's not a significant enough change for more than three or four playthroughs. Overall, I would recommend this game to people who want to sink everything into one playthrough and really commit to a certain build (as I have found all are viable). My only gripe is the boxing missions are near impossible unless you go for a strength build.",

Back then I was extremely optimistic about its future, I kept telling myself that they will turn it around.\n\nAnd there comes the part that bugs me. The post launch support has been weird. Now I must admit I did not follow it very closely, but shouldn't we already have gotten our DLC? At least one of them? With so much content cut out of the game, I expected them to patch stuff back in with DLC's, but the content has been oddly absent (again, if I am mistaken, please correct me). Instead of going full Hello Games on this one, CDPR feels absent and half-hearted about it. \n\nAnd if this game remains the most story-rich and immersive what-if of the gaming history, I will be so pissed...",

        "content": "I will not for a moment defend the disastrous launch of Cyberpunk 2077. It simply should not have happened. However, I will say writing this game off completely because of the launch undermines what is, at times, a very enjoyable experience.\n\nDo I believe this is the best game ever? Absolutely not. Even without the bugs, I think it falls short in a number of areas. For example, in my pursuit of attaining all achievements for this game, my final hours involved repetitive grinding for XP and cash through shooting the same enemy spawns and looting their knives to sell at vending machines.... which was annoying because I had spent the prior 120 or so hours doing fun quests and side quests. To have my final moments of the game reduced to a grind fest was disappointing to say the least. What I'm trying to say is, the world becomes completely baron after you complete everything.... sounds somewhat obvious I know, but I would have at least hoped the game still felt alive with repeatable open world activities, rather than one-offs as part of a quest.\n\nTake street racing for instance. It's reserved only for a handful of quests, so once you complete them, they never appear again. It would be way better if street races could be accessed any time if you need a quick buck. Increasing the variety of activities to do in the open world is something this game needs more than anything else in my opinion. My only option for grinding XP and cash shouldn't be attacking the same enemy spawns and looting their knives over and over....\n\nThat's only if you're going for 100% completion however. I imagine most people won't get to a stage where you have to do repetitive grinding, as most of your cash and XP are earned during quests (and there are A LOT of quests). Whilst I don't think freedom of choice is as strong as it should be (the game does at least give you the illusion of choice) most of the quests in the game are compelling enough, with plenty of variety. Characters are distinct and well written, even if one character in particular has their story cut way too short.\n\nCombat is strong, with plenty of customisation options to tailor your play style, whether it be run and gun or stealth. Driving could be better, as cars become very unstable at high speeds. They need to feel more planted to the road so you feel more confident throwing them into corners. Some vehicle customisation for a future update wouldn't hurt either.\n\nThe major selling point of Cyberpunk is the story. Even if you don't bother too much with side quests, the main story provides a lengthy and memorable science fiction extravaganza. There are multiple endings too. It probably helps to know a bit about the Cyberpunk lore from the tabletop games, though I wouldn't know myself. Finishing this game, at the very least, has compelled to look into the lore.\n\nIn summary, Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game. I'm reluctant to call it great, because I do feel that the open world needs more attention to truly immerse you in Night City. How much you factor in the woeful launch when playing is entirely up to you, but if you can for a moment discard the immense negativity that this game initially received, you might just find an immersive role-playing adventure in here somewhere.\n\n7/10 - Buy it, but only when it's on sale :)",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077, where do I even begin?\n\nBefore I go further in depth about Cyberpunk and it's 'rich' history, I'd like to begin by saying that after patch 1.52, the game is great! I have over 200+ hours on it at the time of writing this review, alongside playthrough's of each life-path and gained several of the endings. Despite it's rough and rocky launch, Cyberpunk has proved itself to be a good game. It's narrative and story are great, followed by amazing voice-acting by Gavin Drea, Cherami Leigh and Keanu Reeves. Their voices and the charisma of each character really helps you enjoy this game's narrative that bit more. Each character has a great piece of character development, providing that you've played their side missions. The characters, and hell, even side-characters in this game are amazing. Not to mention, Night City, being the immersive, buggy mess it is. If you're willing to look past the bugs, this world has amazing and expansive lore that goes outside the game itself. It's so expansive and immersive, I could be stuck in it for hours. It's fully fleshed out, and feels like something that would be real, instead of being a flat boring 2D world. For example, some of the advertisements within the city promote a band whom you can actually see, visit and complete a mission for. Each big location has its own lore too, which is very interesting if you care to read the data shards found within the game. If you're willing to look past the multitude of bugs, Cyberpunk is an amazing game, and I'd highly reccommend that you give it a shot.",

The gameplay is 8/10, lacking proper gun customization and sometimes, the unloaded textures ruin it for you and it's not as immersive as you want it to be. Can't customize your cars at all, can't even change a color lol. Story is great though. Overall, I think it's one of the best games that I've played",

        "content": "There were launch issues, we all know that. Don't let it discolor your perception of the game now that it's been over a year and things have been ironed out. Initially I tried playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a Windows 7 machine, and crashed at least once an hour, and it ran like absolute horror. Upgraded to Windows 10 and it worked perfectly, and once it did, it was a dream. I've put 700 hours into it at this point, working on my seventh playthrough, different styles each time. They've released content patches addressing balance issues and crashes consistently, invalidating my previous 100% crit build, but have clearly strived to keep the game enjoyable and versatile. Each build feels different, and you're given enough points to spread out a bit. The updates to the map system have been amazing, with each new patch specifically addressing areas that might have been weak in the game. Backstory dialog options are always great, and really let you grasp the difference between. They refined the gig system, which are essentially side-side quests, and made it much easier to differentiate quest types in the Journal as well as on the Map. I've always loved the cyberpunk -genre,- but Cyberpunk 2077 embodies it in a way that none else have, and that's speaking as a Shadowrun fan. Cyberpunk 2077 is easily one of my favorite games of all time, and that's placing it ahead of the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises. The writing is amazing, even small conversations between random NPCs that make you laugh or listen in out of curiosity, as well as piecing together plot from picked up shards.",

The story is really interesting and the lore is abundant, there's so much to read. Having bought both books (The World of Cyberpunk and Strategy Guide) I've been able to even understand much more the world around Night City. It's a really dense game... it should be played in slow cook, meaning little by little, digesting each quest which is story-rich and can give you many perspectives. \n\nIn my opinion the game is really really amazing, if you love the genre, this is the one. Female V as a Corpo (My Favourite) has great dialogues, while Male V as a Nomad is a good choice for good dialogues.\n\nIt's amazing!! The vibes Night City gives at night is simply amazing!",

More Feels like All The Years Spent Making It Only The Last Year Or Two Before Release Did They Actually Make The Story. Silverhand And All Seems Like A Last Ditch Effort To Make This Game Happen.",

Quicksave is your friend.\n\n4) Accept that this is kind of like Metal Gear Solid: V Phantom Pain (huh, funny coincidence, that) in that the game isn't necessarily representative of what it should have been. Thankfully, CPR is hard at work to this day, so it's not like the Konami situation. They're doing what they can to make up for the whole debacle. I do think they should have said \"it'll be done when it's done\", but then you end up with a Duke Nukem Forever sitaution where it can't possibly ever reach expectations. I think the moral of the the story here is underpromise and overdeliver. Or something.\n\nIn its current state, it's worth a try. Just don't rush the main quest and ignore everything else. It's not meant to be played that way.\n\nWill be playing this again modded just to see if it's anything like Skyrim and Fallout where the modded experience makes every penny worth it.",

I absolutely loved the gameplay and the way the game allows you to be effective with a huge variety of playstyles.  I don't feel like I ran in to many situations where my characters were incapable because they weren't built a certain way.  There was always a way through it.\n\nThere are some downsides of course.  I don't think this game nailed a cyberpunk environment.  For some reason the developer thinks cyberpunk means the trash collectors went on strike because there are trash bags piling up everywhere.   There was lip service to the corporations being in control of everything, but that didn't translate meaningfully to the feel of the game.  Half the encounters in the game are to help the cops so not very \"punk\".  The endings are just disappointing.  \n\nAll that said I have played through the game with 4 different character builds and enjoyed it thoroughly.",

VR for CP 2077\n\nWithout doubt this will go down as one of the best executed visions of a game I have ever seen, and ive been gaming since the mid-90s. If you are on the fence hop in, if you dont care about college (for you or your spawn) PLEASE go the VR route. Night City is great to look at, but VR puts you IN it, esp when interacting with NPCs.

And in the end what did we get? A cyberpunk narrative filled with a lot of heart, a lot of humanity; a humanity hard to see, beneath all the grime and chaos, but it's there. An apt metaphor if I've ever seen one. \n\nThe 1.5 update in particular really assisted in helping sculpt the game into a better, more structurally sound, and gameplay-balanced place. But even before that, so much of the story, the characters, the atmosphere, and music were already so expertly crafted, that these elements now get to shine even more than they already did. Initially a 7 out of 10 game with several 10 out of 10 moments. To reconcile all this now, it finds some center around an enthusiastic 8.5 out of 10, maybe, even though arbitrary review scores don't matter. What does matter is how you feel, and I love this game. In spite of its flaws. That's how I feel.\n\nWhen faced with death, with surviving it, being born anew, what do you decide is most important to you? Love, togetherness, the chance at a hopeful horizon? Glory, spite, and the desire to leave the biggest mark you can? Or is it persistence, survival, the need to remain - no matter what it costs? It's a decision we all must make, and it is in how we save ourselves, that we define who we are in the world around us. \n\nBe who you are, freely, authentically, without recourse. Live. Live while you can. And remember: Never stop fighting. \n\np.s. yorinobu did nothing wrong",

I love RPG games.\nThe first time I launched the game, the first game that came to my mind was Vampire The Masquerade, Bloodlines and I was very happy with the anticipation. I had the expectation, that after many months of the developers, fixing this game, I could give it a chance. For now, I'm thinking that I was wrong and I encourage everyone on Linux to wait a bit more.\n\nThe game has a great atmosphere and sucks you in instantly. Characters are great and recognizable. Besides that, it crashes constantly and downloads more than 60 GB of content if something gets corrupted, which is not good for your hard drive. \n\n It is really ... really frustrating. \n\nI'm thinking of trying to get a refund for this.",

        "content": "I have been here since Day 1 and there is so much to tell about this game\u2026\n\nI experienced the disastrous launch this game had and saw the tremendous backlash CDPR faced, but it was well deserved: they have become the very thing they swore to destroy.\nThe marketing team in charge of Cyberpunk was given free-reign to promise everything and nothing to the players. Thanks to that, they were able to build an incredible hype around this game, but completely failed to deliver on so many promises\u2026\nI think players should have seen it coming. The hype was so high, that even if CDPR delivered a game that was mostly bug-free and worked perfectly from day 1, it still would have received a negative press from the players.\nI can\u2019t help feel sorry for the artists and the developers who worked on Cyberpunk. \nCDPR, in its rush to get this game out, lost a golden opportunity to deliver one of the best game in history.\n\nNow about the game itself, we can all agree that this game is no GTA. The gameplay and the open world might feel somehow lacking compared to what was promised or compared to other games.\nI can understand people arguing if Cyberpunk 2077 was good or bad, or saying that this game was wasted potential, etc. \nBut what nobody can't deny is that Cyberpunk is an absolute masterpiece in terms of story writing, world building, music, voice acting, art, ambience and experience.\nYou will feel drawn by this dystopic world (that is not far for ours on some points) and by the characters you will meet during your journey. This game is going to touch your deepest emotions and some of the scenes will hit you hard by making you think about life, death, suicide, friendship, love, etc\u2026\n\nThe players who loved this game are still waiting for CDPR to redeem itself just like Hello Games did with No Man\u2019s Sky. More than 1 year has passed and the recent patch 1.5 fixed a lot of thing, but I think it is not enough.\n\nThere are still bugs, part of the gameplay feels clunky and the weird game pacing still bothers me: you are slowly dying during Act 2 but still find time to do side gigs? \nAlso, I can\u2019t help but think that there is definitively some content missing in Act 1. Come on CPDR, we want a whole arc/act with Jackie and not just a quick cutscene with him: the game flow would have been much better if the entire main story was put at the end of the game. The game starts out as normal, but you don't get the montage and the time skip. Instead, you are allowed to explore Night City with Jackie. You can buy your first car, move out to your own apartment, and do jobs for the various fixers in town.\nAnd once you get enough street cred, you get a call from Jackie letting you know that he has a sweet gig lined up that would take you to the big leagues. When you talk to Jack, you can choose to start the job, but Jack will tell you that there is no turning back after this, and the game will let you know that it is the (first) point of no return. The game then plays out normally, starting with meeting Dex.\n\nOverall Cyberpunk 2077 is a good game. Now that it had some real bug fixes and that its price went down I would highly recommend you to give it a try. However, I still feel like this game should only be played on PC or on the new gen consoles.",

The story is very rich and engrossing, and the game-play (especially since the 1.5+ update) is very good. This game may never equal the hype that was heaped on it for years, but it is fun, engaging, and can be modded to get it closer to that ideal.",

Combat is really fun, many possible builds, graphix is pretty good once you disable the anyoing options. Overall a really good game.\nBut what really is the selling point for me is the story. Try it and you wont regret it.",

        "content": "It's been over a year and even after 1.5 patch the game has tons of bugs. Some can even soft lock the game were you need to reload your previous save or use cheats to fix it without losing your progress. When bugs happen so often that you don't know if its a bug or that's by design. It's just sad. I wanted to like this game, i really did, but this is just bad.\n\nSimple things like for example mouse cursor on in game PC's disappear and you have to navigate it blindly.\nAfter reloading a gun it starts shooting automatically for no reason.\nAudio problems, one person talks loud as hell, the other is silent, or there is no voice audio at all.\nSimple stuff like reflections, police cars rear lights sometimes become brighter than the sun to the point where you have to turn on first person camera while driving cause you can't see anything.\nRadio in cars doesn't change or start playing properly, there were times where i have to stop the car, get out, get back in, then the radio station changes.\nWhen you need to use a MOD to fix multi-core performance issues so it uses all the cores and actually boosts your FPS you know the game has serious issues.\nThe fact that the bug that was on launch in 2020 still exist in 1.5 where when you're driving normally you suddenly get yeeted in to space for no reason is mind boggling.\n\nI can go on and on about bugs in this game, there are plenty, in the end, is the game worth it?\nNot really, don't waste your money unless you really, really want it and its on a sale 50+% off.\nIs it playable? Yes, but its not acceptable giving its been over a year and the game feels like its in Early Access. It's just sad.\n\nI played it when it originally launched and passed it in 2 sittings i was so exited(haven't touched it sense), now bought it on steam(to keep my games on one platform) after 1.5 was released hoping its better, but it kinda was a waste of money.\nGonna finish my second playthrough and most likely never touch this game again, maybe in 2077.\n\nI really hope in the future i get to change this review in to a positive one, but for now;\nNot Recommended.",

The characters story and development is excellent. There aren't too many games out there with great storyline for the NPCs, and Cyberpunk does. After logging over 70hours into this game I have genuine appreciation for the depth of the character development. I hope the next installment of GTA takes notes and do a better job with the main characters and NPC's. It truly is a game changer. WELL that was the good... The bad for me that stood out was the vehicle driving mechanics. The cars are terrible to drive, and the motorcycles are best way to get around town quickly, but they have some serious impossible physics when interacting with other vehicles and objects. Second issue with this game is the the road network. I seem like the city and play area was laid out then some intern at RED was given the job of creating the road network. The layout is terrible and follows no logic or pattern at all. Also, while the cars handling are terrible, it would be nice to have upgrade options for the cars and apartments... That gripe aside, it is an awesome game, and if they make a part two, of take it online like GTA, I will be among the first customers.",

That being said, at the 1.52 release and there are still bugs pretty much everywhere, but things are better than launch by 1,000%.  Still, I had a game killing bug happen to me the other day.  So, if you play, remember to have 4-5 games saves you are rotating through, so if you find a show stopping bug like I did, a true game killer, you can jump back 30 minutes and avoid the same thing on a second playthrough.....which is so much better than starting the game over from scratch.",

It has songs that i would actually want to listen again\n+Graphics are one of the best, nothing can beat night city during nighttime while it is raining. Badlands look surprisingly good and natural too\n+Voice acting and the detailed animations really make you feel the characters\n\nCons\n-Bugs. The bug i face the most is that my bike gets stuck in the fence.\n-Handling could be improved, cars skid way too much\n-NPC AI needs an overhaul\n-No police chases in an open world crime game, that's underwhelming\nOverall- 8.5/10",

Visually it is stunning, Characters are great and the story itself is really captivating as well.\n\n\nThe MAJOR downside is, this game is incredibly SHORT. The main story line can be basically completed in a couple evenings. There's a couple side arcs in the game, but they're also very short and only contribute to unlocking additional endings in the main story. Once you finish the main story and their arcs, there's not much else to do except do repetitive gigs and side jobs the are all basically the same. I know the developers wanted to make a shorter game due to issues with TW3 being too long, but this is just ridiculous.\n\n\nUltimately I'm satisfied with the visuals and story of the game but just disappointed at how incredibly short it is.",

But a game hasn't hooked me in like this since HL2 many years ago. CP2077 is so immersive and huge and fun, I feckin love it! 150hrs+ so far and nowhere near done.\n\nNight City is glorious to behold and there's so much to do it's crazy. The main story is superb, as are many of the side stories. The missions with Panam in particular. But if you just wanna have an eve fuckin up some punks and blowing off steam, you can, and it's fun as heck. Combat is awesome and only gets better as you get your stats up. You can be quite creative! The game is complex, but not off-puttingly so. There is a pretty steep learning curve initially and it's not always clear what it's trying to teach you, but you get there soon enough. You'll spend a fair amount of time in the menus crafting, upgrading, swapping and changing.\n\nYes it's not without it's issues, but nothing major for me. The odd graphical glitch here and there but nothing like on other platforms. And yes if you wanna crank the graphics you'll need a beast of a gfx card and even then 4k is a pipe-dream. 1440p is the best my 3080TI can do getting ~65-75fps with RT/DLSS-Q on.\n\nSomething that very few people mention... the sound in this game is badass and adds so much to the immersion. Plus some of the weapon sounds give me goosebumps. That feel-it-in-the-chest duuf duuf duuf duuf, mwahahaha.\n\nBest game ever.",

Now i didnt get it, i held off and im glad i did, once i had the money again i picked it up around january 2022 right before 1.5, I love it, I sure hope more is added in the future but the characters are good, the style is crazy, wish there was more to the Net and the more niche aspect of NC Life, but Cyberpunk 2077 though not the rpg to end all rpgs, is a fun ride, a great way to escape, there was care put into the project and it shows, Thank you CDPR",

Obviously my perception might be affected by it, so make of that detail whatever you want.\n\nIf you are considering buying this one, I know what you are thinking. Yeah yeah, the game that promissed everything and fell short. I know, the whole internet knows. But you know what? The game is fun alright, bunch of stuff to do, and the approach you choose can be very different.\n\nYou can build yourself to be a master of melee weapons, katanas, an invisible cheeky breeky mofo that deals everything with knifes to the skull or silenced guns, a gunslinger, rifleman, a Neo style slow-mo bastard, a hackerman that doesn't even need guns, whatever. It all feels different, gives a lot of replayability options.\n\nThe game looks beastly. Seriously, creating a city with a setting as particular as a dystopian future, that feels massive and believable as the one here, is not something you see everyday. Sometimes I just walk or drive around only to sightsee because it truly looks amazing.\n\nThe story, the side missions, all of that is very immersive. I can get if you prefer this type of games in 3rd person, but quite frankly, it wouldn't feel the same if it wasn't in 1st person. Plus, depending on how you build your character, you may have different choices on certain missions, making each re-play slightly different.\n\nIn terms of bugs, well I got the game after patch 1.5 and I've only experienced 3, nothing game breaking. Fairly standard amount for any game and two of them were quite hilarious. Picture the first cutscene but everyone is on T-pose for the first seconds, then you call your motorcycle just for it to fly by the Corpo Plaza overpass and crash land on a car. Third one I fell off the map, but it just re-spawned me a few meters away. Nothing game breaking.\n\nDon't even get me started about the music, I'm already trying to learn these badass Samurai songs.\n\nI could keep going on and on about the things that I like, because once more, this game is damn fun. Clearly it was the foundation for a masterpiece that couldn't be everything that was invisioned, with lots of promises that couldn't be delivered because of corpo bs, but thats a whole different story.\n\nAnd for the record, I'm that type of person that doesn't care about games with story, or open world, or single player in general because they somehow bore me within the first few hours of play. But this one, this one's got that special touch to it.\n\nSeriously hoping they keep adding stuff to the point that it gets closer and closer to what was promised, not only because I'd like to see this game be everything that we expected, but also because I'd love to see a continuation to it.",

The lingering bugs were more of the endearing, comical, Bethesda variety (IYKYK), and the general experience was pretty solid. Fast forward to the 1.5 update, and I start to see what the devs meant by \"this is closer to the game we wanted to release to begin with.\" MASSIVE quality of life improvements, tighter gameplay with almost no gameplay-affecting glitches in sight (I almost miss random NPCs T-posing atop moving cars they're supposedly driving), some actual ludonarrative consistency in the secondary attributes of loot drops (how were combat boots supposed to help you quickhack faster?), and many other welcome improvements. It was a good game before - aforementioned comedic glitches notwithstanding - but I would say this is finally a game that justifies nearly a decade of development hell (oh hey, didn't see you there, DNF). If you haven't scored this title yet, buy it, and encourage any console bros you know to give it a shot. It's safe for them now. But still give them crap on general principle, because PCMR. Also, Judy is love, Judy is life, Judy is best girl. Play as Fem!V and romance her, you will not regret it.",

By then, some of the bugs had been cleaned up, but not all. The ones I found were more laughable than annoying, though I saw the frustration of early purchasers and pre-orders. \n\nOnce I started playing the game, though, I really found myself hooked on it. The world is beautiful and immersive, and the characters well-written and acted. [spoiler]As a dude who grew up near East LA, the Valentinos actually reminded me of some folks i knew.[/spoiler] \n\nThe cars are all unique and varied, except that they all handled like ass. I love that the new update gave V more options for apartments. Having hubs in the different districts is super convenient. \n\nThe story was wonderfully compelling. Coming to terms with death is no easy thing to write about, and the team at CDPR did a great job of it. The NCPD gigs do get a bit redundant, though. If you've seen one pack of gangoons, you've seen 'em all. \n\nThe music is pretty good, and 'Never Fade Away' and 'A Like Supreme' is are two of my new favorite songs. There's a vast selection of weapons for every taste, and with the cyber-arm mods available in-game, there's a variety of options for melee fighters as well. \n\nAll in all, I'll probably end up re-playing the game multiple times because I enjoyed it so much. Yes, the criticism is well-deserved in parts, and overall my biggest gripe was the lack of options after [spoiler]you meet Hanako at Embers. Once you decide on a path, you're stuck.[/spoiler] There are multiple endings, with only one of them feeling anything close to hopeful. That aside, to me Night City is worth visiting time and time again because out of all the neon dystopias, only this one and the Los Angeles seen in Blade Runner feel real to me.",

To be honest i really did enjoyed my playthrough, and i was quite supprised. It may have been the recent update to the game might not, but most of the game for me felt great. It had its bright moments, very memorable for me is the yacht destruction with Kerry Eurodine. The soundtrack? The Radio stations? Hell yeah. It hit for me in so many places, and then getting the SAMURAI band together. Whoooooooo boyyyy. I could see bit better gunplay, id appretiated more customizable vehicles and better driving overall (most fun i had while driving was with motocycles), few bobs here and there but overall hell yeah i loved it. And then the ending. I was not really emotional or sad about my ending (unlike in previous game by CD PROJECT The Witcher Wild Hunt), but to be honest i got really depressed. The game left scars on me, good and bad that i will bare some time. I do recommend you try the game, eventhough its not 100% clean i do have hope in CD PROJECT to finish and polish their game to its best. I cant wait for more DLCs for this game",

        "content": "Just buy it. Keep in mind though, this review is something I have been working on since before the big patch recently. \nI bought this game back in the beginning of February-ish, and I immediately fell in love with it. I have played about 50 hours into each of the three versions of the story, meaning I played through pretty much everything at least twice. I have seen inside and outside of Night City. All the gonks and chooms alike. \n\nThe music is what I have to talk about first. I am a big music lover. My favourite headphones at the moment are my ATH-M50x's, with my laptops built in dtsX sound. With or without those, the music and the sound are top-notch. But with them, I was LIVING in NIght City..sure, there were some spots where audio was off, or missing or something, but overall it was 99% perfect. People walking, talking...hearing people in other languages talking about everything from itchy dongs, to financial portfolios on the news. Hell, even the advertisements are kinda spot on lol! If you don't love the music, then you are not even a person. Seriously, it is one of the biggest things for me. So many games have trash music, or just basic standard....meh music. just meh... But this game, you can tell some people were working really hard to set the mood...and baby MY EARS ARE MOIST AND READY TO BE PENETRATED BY THOSE GOOD VIBRATIONS!!!\n\nWeird visuals aside, the game is magnificient. Yes there are bugs, but in my personal experience, most of the bugs are either really common, and you learn how to avoid them...For instance, stairs on the various water-towers around the city would let me fall through the stairs RIGHT at the very top, so i just learned that if I was sprinting or if I jumped, it was no longer a problem. But aside from that, the only issues I seemed to have happen a lot involved items being visible, having the \"pick up\" option show up but the item can't be picked up. Seemed to only happen to a handfull of food items, never weapons/ammo/armor or key/quest items either. Honestly, there are not so many game-breaking bugs that everybody kept talking about. \n\n_______________________________________\n\nAfter big patch:\n\nKind of just the same as above, but now the police are far more obnoxious....The one thing I loved, that being the police being easy to evade, was changed. I know it is a weird thing to complain about, all things considered, but I was having fun mercing some gangsters...police officer showed up, I was about to leap with my Mantis Blades...and well, certain animations may or may not have played out with the officer being the star of the show....allegedly! next thing you know, guns are sprouting from the walls and there were so many officer-shaped objects on the ground for about three city blocks...then I just exploded. Don't mess with the police in this game, they will explode you.\n\nBuy it, play it, fall in love with it...\nVisuals: 9/10. There were quite a few visual issues.\nMusic: 69/10. Best music, best audio. \nGameplay: 8/10. Highest I have ever given a game like this.\nCharacter Creation: 6/10. 7/10 for adding dicks and tits without shame. But let me look at myself while I shower. Genuinely not for perverted reasons, literally just to say you guys are the only game that does it.\nDriving: 6/10. I have played a lot of NFS and a bit of Forza...gotta say, only a couple of vehicles in this game feel like they drive, and trust me on this...I DROVE EVERYWHERE, or ran. I barely used quick travel at all. The car I felt like drove the best was the \"Javellina\" or the all-white version of Caliburn in town. Oh, and the Shion Coyote drove like a miracle with mouse/keyboard and controller. I liked a motorcycle, but I can't remember the name. Its the only purple one with a back-support seat as well.\n\n",

Hopefully we will get multiple expansions that will transform this from a good game to a great one and add in all the missing features we all want.  Because it has the potential to be one of the best.\n\nIt now deserves the scores reviewers have given it, before this it was a poor 6, its now a solid 8.",

That being said, not a fan of the FP perspective to be honest, but, its more than acceptable. Still a few graphical glitches here and there that pop up on rare occasions, even on an RX 5700 card but smooth for the most part. So much like Crysis back in the day (the original one not the remastered). If you're rig can run it, you're in for a treat. How does it compare to Witcher 3? It doesn't. The FPS makes game play quite different. The attributes, there's almost too many, like the designers had too much coffee and couldn't decide what to cut. Story and characters, so far not too bad. They are interesting, unlike the cut and paste (aka boring) ones in The Outer Worlds. So if you thought W3 was a 9 or 10. This, might be a 7 or 8. Still not bad for a first dive into the whole cyberpunk world. Remember Witcher 1 wasn't exactly stellar, story was good, game play was so so. Hoping CDPR can keep it together and learn from this to keep improving on it and create a sequel. Be a shame for them to fold from one game because they felt forced to rush by the industry and especially greedy investors. Learn from Blizzard back in the day, release games, when they are done.",

The decisions I made both before, during and after the main questline finale were, to me, deep, meaningful choices.  I took a few minutes to decide what I would do as V...not what I'd do as a \"gamer\".  I came to terms with my decisions, and they weren't light choices.\n\nA shooter RPG-lite that many times during the game gave me quests and decisions that I wanted to review mentally when I wasn't playing.  To me, that's as good as it gets.  The ending has opened up even more plotlines/lines of thought ...this game does a good job of covering the bases of many of the issues \"cyberpunk\" as Gibsen wrote it.\n\nI'm pretty darn happy and will continue to play as well as roll new characters.\n\n\n\n\n\n3-31-22 (57 hours)\n\nFinding the game is full of in-jokes, movie references, and lots of little treats for the player spread across the huge map.  I originally thought this was going to be a more graphical Deus Ex, but it's more like a GTA on steroids.  The huge neighborhoods, with something around every corner, evident cultures, emergent gameplay, etc.  Deep skilltrees to create the play experience you like.  Non-linear gameplay allows you to just drive around and listen to music, be a bounty hunter, or engage in the dozens of npc questlines, all without touching the main questline.\n\nThere are few things I find lacking:  one, is the ability to get trapped in an area with the only way to escape is death and reload from a previous save point, and the skill system lets you reset your perks, but not your base attributes...so your first playthrough, if you don't know what you want to do will create a number of wasted points.\n\nAll in all, this is a game where you can do what you want, with a skilset that you want, using gear that you want.  The combat experience is excellent (stealth it out, cyber it out, or go in guns or knives whirling...you decide).  The characters are very fleshed out and full of...character.  The world is the most living I've seen in a game yet.  Great all around.\n\nDo get a powerful, current PC before jumping in though; that will make a huge difference to your gaming experience.\n\n\nWas okay with an 15 and a 1060, but with an I7 and a 2070, this game is like watching a movie.  You really can't get the immersion with an old PC.  Great story, interesting characters and I didn't mind letting the conversations unfold.",

I'm a massive fan of Skyrim and have put numerous hours into that game on multiple platforms and GTA is one of my all-time favorite game series; somehow this game has been able to merge my favorite parts of the two series and blend them into one very large, very beautiful package. The world is so incredibly immersive and expansive, in my 36 hours (at review) I feel as though I've only explored a fraction of what this world has to offer. There have been a handful of bugs in my time with this game but nothing game breaking, and in a game with this much going on, it's a miracle it runs as smooth as it does with as few bugs as I've encountered. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive RPG with an engaging story and an expansive open-world.",

Story mode is pretty quick to roll through and that's why I do believe we could have gotten more. But even despite being short, it's still very good. \n\nMy biggest wishes, were more content in the way of customization. More tattoo options, body scars, body types, more control over piercing combos. Stuff like that. I'm definitely very glad they patched in the ability to change your appearance later if you want that was a big thing a lot of people had issues with. But these are all pretty minor requests in the grand scheme of things. Basically I'm a sucker for a real in depth character creator, and will basically spend hours in just that if I can.",

        "content": "Let me start by \"im playing since 1.5\" i really don't know how bad the game was before, but i think every game now is the same thing, a disaster when they lunch and then little by little the game gets fixed, examples: Wolcen, No mans sky, FFXV, Borderlands 3, etc etc etc...\n\nNow the preface is over i will continue with the review:\n\n\n- The whole scene of the game feels like hand carved, it's like a massive diorama, i don't know how to put it in words, but the amount of details this game has is overwhelming, every little thing is modeled, every little detail is looked after, obviously if you look really hard you can see some flaws here and there, but if you compare it to any game out there, i think cyberpunk actually nails it, and for me is more than enough.\n\n- The gunplay is awesome, it's like Doom / Destiny / Borderlands had a child. And melee combat is just muaaaah chef Kiss\n\n- The soundtrack, awesome and with incredible variety, first time i spent much time in a game and don't turn off the music.\n\n- Immersion, this game makes you feel the threats, the shots, in simple words, im kind of the gun frenzy fps player, this game made me take cover, think beforehand encounters, scan areas etc etc...\n\n- Graphics, thou im not running it on RTX since i don't like DLSS, makes everything blurry, this will be given from an ultra-settings perspective, and honestly i don't feel like RTX is necessary, maybe im old school i don't know, but the difference is not much, the game simply looks awesome in either way.\n\n- Controls, so far only thing i think needs improvement is on how motorcycles and some cars feel when turning, aside from that, everything is spot on.\n\n- Story wise it made me feel like when I was young and playing FFX for the first time, it\u2019s like you are playing a movie and you are the main character, most games have lost that but cyberpunk takes it a step forward and slams you Keanu in the face and some plot twists that are really awesome, the game tends to give you some mind fucks from time to time. To resume it, you feel the story and you live the story.\nHeck even this game made me make a review, to make justice to it, and with just 60hrs on play im not even half the game because I\u2019ve been immersed doing side quests that are actually good and content from the map\u2026\n\nRegarding Bugs only one so far i've encountered is the epistrophy quest, can't progress after pacifica, west side encounter with the thugs, and a bug with the phone that sat me back like 30min of gameplay to a previous save to fix it.\n\nSo to give it a final score, here is a less talky review:\n5 Stars / 5 Stars\n\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2611 You forget what reality is\n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2611 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2610 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2611 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2611 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2610 Never heard of\n\u2611 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2611 10\n",

        "content": "I can understand the root of bytching that the initial release of CP2077 raised. That doesn't mean I agree with it. The game itself is much better than bytching suggests. Well, fuck you all. It is not perfect but I like it. \n\nI can see a tendency of overambitious game projects that after a time become NoManSky-ed by the mean of being constantly fixed, patched, improved and enhanced to fulfil promises, to the point of delivery. Well, as long as these games are worked on I'm okay with that. I'm not going anywhere.\n\nCyberpunk. Genre. Deus Ex approaches the thing rather from the cyber, CP2077 rather from the punk side: less peddling with tech and more action. The very unfair description of this game would describe it as a cross between GTA, Deus Ex and some typical UBIsoft map-puzzle action game to some extent. But as a whole it is none of them really. Where it is outstanding in my opinion is the story line and the way it is put into the vivid game world. Also it has cyberpunk veteran Keanu Reeves whose presence is implemented a pretty cool way I think. The game world is massive and stunning. If you ever wondered what would be around the corner in Blade Runner that the movie never shows, here you are. I spent many hours just to look around. As for a game it is a quite decent fun RPG so yes there are bugs consequently. Do you remember Skyrim, Witcher, Fallout New Vegas or Fallout2 if you are old enough? All decent RPGs have complex worlds that mean bugs. As for performance it was tagged as a resource hog but as far as my experience goes the PC version was playable even before patch 1.5 and after that it improved nicely, running smoothly even on my modest RX570+Ryzen5 system.\n\nYep 1.5 was an important step. There are things that are sort of shady still, for example handling of vehicles. It is improved much since the first release but it still feels off*. There is no sense of weight. Even decade++ old GTA IV has more definition. Actually GTA IV is a much better driver considering physics than GTA V in my humble opinion. Well, who cares. No one will read this anyway.\n\n* I kept CP2077 on ice for a while and checked again after 1.52 patch and vehicle handling seems to be singificantly smoother. The Radeon brown tint bug changed to Radeon green tint bug but dark textures still look much better. It may sound a little sarcastic but it is not, I really appreciate the new patches and looking forward to play coming DLCs. I hope CD Project Red will create something like the awesome Witcher 3 DLC pack.",

Now before i start, i do have a slight bias as i have a pretty low standard when it comes to games. If it looks cool, i'll play it regardless of how bad people say it is and probably like it a lot myself, as with this game. I genuinely loved this game. I loved the sheer size of it and the world it's built upon. The voice acting, the characters are all so rememberable for me. The immersion (bugs and glitches aside) was fantastic. I felt like i was in this world in the future that realistically could make sense. The gameplay mechanics were really fun (recommend for pc play only as i didn't find the console gameplay as fun or thrilling). The cars were super cool. Going to go ahead and add Reeves cause he played his part well and i was very thrilled to see him throughout the game. Anyway, i recommend for those with really beefy pc's and a good amount of patience. I find the replay value pretty damn high as you have different paths to take, different dialogue options that matter. All very exciting. \n\nI'm also waiting for new game plus to start the game over with my endgame gear.",

I don't know what will happen if you don't have a ray tracing video card, but it automatically sets to ray tracing on high giving you 15 FPS no matter what PC you use. doesn't matter if you have a Core I9 64GB RAM and an RTX 3090, it's still gonna lag when you first launch.

Now playing through in full.\nI hope we get more content and things to do, not to say it doesn't have huge amounts to do now, but would love more.\nGreat story, plays well, even on a GTX 960 4GB. Highlights: Talking vending machine quest, spiritual journey, netrunners, evil AIs, dancing robots and more.",

Not all of your available options are displayed and you may have to flail while pressing your physical buttons for things to happen on-screen. Do you enjoy hyper-complicated skill trees with 1/3 of upgrades doing nothing to impact the overall game? If so, this will stroke you nicely. \n\nDoing a blind playthrough on \"hard\" difficulty is accurate; having to replay sections due to dying is to be expected, but beating a challenge after a hazard or enemies don't spawn . . . I'll take that as a sad, lowercase win to progress the story along. \n\nCool, you've learned how to stealth kill with a tutorial within the first ten minutes of starting the game. However, I never was given the option to stealth kill and had to used weapons and make noise to murder. After two days of playing, in real life, the option to stealth kill somehow un-bugged and turned itself on -- frustrating. Some area-specific N.P.C. enemies will spawn forever, so, lame. Also, don't stream this game due to the pervy nude sex scenes that cannot be skipped . . .   \n\nPlay if you have time to kill and like single-player, slow-paced stories, that have too much going on without much resolution -- like a junior Game of Thrones -- or a more depressed Grand Theft Auto game. Speaking of story I have no emotional investment in what is happening, and I honestly forget about most of the characters or what they contribute to the game's progression when they are not part of a current mission I'm completing.",

        "content": "At first I was kinda disappointed, expecting a lot more overall depth in side quests and environmental story telling, like Witcher 3. You can somehow feel the game was rushed a bit at the end, a lot of unused opportunities story wise etc. But that doesn't mean in any way this is a bad game, the story is intriguing and some of the side quests are absolutely phenomenal (The Hunt / Paralez quest line). Although, especially the Paralez quest had me like \"that's it?! I want answers, who or what is behind this!?\", talking about missed opportunity...  Gameplay mechanics are solid, hacking is quite fun and gives lots of options. Graphics wise, the game is simply stunning, if you have a rig that's capable of RTX with decent frame rate this has to be one of the best looking games out there.\n\nI didn't encounter many bugs, even in the first version of the game, guess I got lucky on that part. After patch 1.5 the game should be a LOT more solid, shame that the game wasn't in that state at release.\n\nOverall, Cyberpunk is a must if you're remotely into story driven single player games",

The game does well to flex its production value, but there is a distinct lack of variety when it comes down to the 2D flash animation sex scenes. In fact, you might even be disturbed to know that there are ABSOLUTELY NO 2D FLASH ANIMATION SEX SCENES in this game. \n\nUnless you're looking for a AAA next-gen narrative-driven open world action adventure first person shooter with role-play elements, you will be disappointed with Cyberpunk 2077.",

It is clear that CDPR put a lot of effort into creating a detailed environment to explore.  I have particularly enjoyed wandering around the city listening to random conversations between npcs that are surprisingly detailed, and seeing the small details it hard to reach places.\n\nDuring my various play throughs I have not experienced any significant bugs, glitches or crashes.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the character Johnny Silverhand who is foisted on the player fairy early in the game.   He is the central character in many unskippable \"interactive\" cut scenes that, while mildly interesting the first time, are a tremendous pain on subsequent play throughs .  The first such cut scene takes over 35 minutes to get through even spamming the skip dialogue button.   As the player is unable to respec abilities (only perks can be changed for a nominal fee)  I have restarted from failed builds and thus waded thru this cut scene numerous times.\n\nI think the game would have been much better if Silverhand was an actual antagonist or opponent rather than a cancer the player is saddled with.\n\nOne thing the game is missing is a more challenging difficulty  setting.  The current \"Very Hard\" setting is not  very taxing and by the time the player is lvl 35ish (out of 50) most content in the game is fairly straight forward to get thru.",

        "content": "This game gets a bad rap sometimes, which can be deserved in certain circumstances, though my experience has been a good one. It is very much recommended if you want an experience, and not just another way to shoot some NPC's and rack up the kills and stats, though fun can be had in this area as well!  The Modding scene is pretty spectacular, if you are into that sort of thing, with a lot of options for customization! This game definitely requires a rig that is up to snuff, especially if you plan to play at any of the higher resolutions and detail levels.  That said, it is totally worth it if you have the capability!  \n\nI have played the game through to the end three times now, and every single time, I have found another reason to like it, and it continues to deliver!  You WILL be disappointed if you rush through, from mission to mission, just trying to get to the endgame, and I would argue that you will completely miss the point of the whole work if this is how you play.  A huge amount of effort went into the creation of the world, and much of the story. Take your time, be meticulous, and spend some time exploring, 'living' Night City a little!  Explore the alleys and underpasses!  Actually Read the data shards scattered all over the place!  Watch the sunset over the city skyline from the hill or top of the penthouse once in awhile!  Let the enormity of it all and the attention to detail sink in, and you will see what I mean!\n\nThere is also some opportunity to explore your humanity a little in the context of the situations the protagonist experiences throughout the story line and game play, if you care about that sort of thing.  You are given the choice to act how you choose, and it gives you a chance, if you allow it, to explore yourself, your actions, and your feelings in situations you most probably would never want to find yourself in normally.  You'll find yourself loving or hating, even empathizing with certain characters as you play, and learn more about them and their lives as the story progresses.\n\nThat said, this game does deserve some of the criticism that has been leveled at it:  I think expectations were set very high initially and in some ways it does fail to deliver on much of the hype.  Also, there are still, to this day, some minor compatibility issues and gripes about some aspects of the game, but overall I have had a very good experience, especially with the latest update (1.5 as of this writing).  Most crashing I have experienced is the result of corrupted files, and if you check the forums, you can usually figure out what other things can lead to crashes, so there are solutions if you find yourself in trouble.",

        "content": "Still disappointing. I was sold on it going to be a deus ex mixed with open world. but in the end I got a very by the numbers open world game with leveling in the vain of something like dead by daylight. Not what I wanted, and not what was sold to me. well some story missions do have some verity in terms of how you handle the content. it really just makes me realize that it would have gotten that feel better if they skipped out on that open world and just did level based. but we'll get to that\n\nWell the game can look as pretty as it wants to me gameplay will always matter more. I rarely mod older games to look \"better\" since art direction is what carried it. tho I will say even on low settings the world has a really good sense of style and does a great job at getting the scale of a cyber punk mega city that is build on top of itself. that being said, if you do have the gpu and cpu to run it at a high level: fuck me the bloom is stupid. form my point of view it screams \"movie\" and not \"REAL\" tho since we see the world so much through   fake eyes in the game that works out? there's moments where it's really pretty and other times where it's just- everything feels too clean and ends up being this more fake feeling world.\n\nNow- for a little background for me: I have animation, cgi, effects and film background. well I work more as illustrator now, I still have a pretty good eye for this do to me having to work as clean up. So when it fails that speaks to me more than anything else. for people with eyes not as well trained it might not be an issues. and I'm pretty sure it won't be.  but this is a subjective review as all good reviews should be.\n\nBut lets touch on this open world. and more over how you get around it. cars handle aweful with a keyboard and mouse. I couldn't play on launch, but if this is how they handle AFTER the patches they still have a long way to go. if you don't mind running shit over and driving crazy than it's fine. but if you like to drive- you know- normally. there's not much you can do. the camera keeps resetting to a stupidly low angle to the car the car auto hard brakes and keeps doing it when I didn't want it to. there;s also no REAL brake. just backing up. so stopping at a light as me looking like I'm trying to parallel park going forwards and back. the AI and lights- don't work together. I'd often see them ignoring it outright and soon I just did too. If there were more control of your car like switching gears or some way to fucking brake so I can control my hard turns I might enjoy driving my car.\n\nand open world side missions are so- bad too. not all are still I had one where I had to save a ripper from a gang. I sneak in from a vent system, only to be spotted in side the vents with combat starting right away. in fact steal REALLY needs a longer delay. if someone knows you are there the whole fucking place will just know straight up. meaning you are either in stealth or not. even if the dude didn't fight his gun or did anything load they will all know. and seemly never forget. so you have to ghost all stealth.\n\nlastly lets talk about leveling and gear. fuck me is it annoying to dump loads of crafting supplies into a weapon only for it to still become so out classed that you'll still need to abandon it. and fuck me is it annoying how badly put together the leveling is. why give use the choice to stealth when you are just assuming it's going to fail?? Why not make skills that let us- you know- not fail? why does quickhacking have to share buffs to doing said quick hacks with CRAFTING quickhacks??? shouldn't that be under fucking crafting???? why is there a fucking skill called 200% efficiency when it gives a 2.5% armor buff to crafted clothing. how the fuck will 2.5% even fucking matter are you taking the fucking piss project red?? you made good skill trees before why are you failing now??\n\nand speaking of disappointments: the story. in case you still wanna play it I won't spoil it. but out side of some order you don't get a lot of choices on how stuff happens. it's disappointing coming from witcher 3. and will likely never change. if it does some how change I'll sure look like a jerk. but there's no way they can get all the actors back in and redo all the voice lines and do anything major. and The co-lead of silverhand really just ended up making me like corpo. I'm shocked anyone fallowed him cause he lost all charm in how he talked and treated people.  stuck in this moody pre-teen bullshit where he can't explain his feelings. and in fact V often stuggles to do the same. tho that's also cause I had to guess how they would say stuff. \"Question their motives\" could be V taken a back and wanting to get filled in in a chill way, or it could be them questioning the persons whole fucking ideal and acting like they are bullshit. Like V knows the other party better. and without something that can tell me what tone they are going to take I have to roll the dice every time.\n\nI think the game is in a state were it's more than playable and I can safely say there's just some core design ideas that hold it back from being more than a 6/7 out of 10 for me. and more than 3 or 2 if I wasn't willing to take it for what it is rather than the deus ex open world I was OG sold on. a lot of lies that are still not added in. Making it at lest work at a stable fps with new houses isn't going to fix that.\n\nI'm sorry for any typos. I'm making this fresh off the game and with out a second draft. wanting to get my feelings out in a raw way before I forget.",

        "content": "I recommend that you buy it on sale if you love the genre and if you digg action games with rpg elements. They never should have released it in 2020 and they were shady with informing about performance on launch. \n\nBought on Gog at launch and I found it lacking the promised content so I refunded it.\n\nBought it on sale and tried it again when 1.5 dropped. Coming with tempered expectations, I can say that it's a pretty good game now! Just don't expect the deepest rpg ever. It's a good action game with some rpg elements. Still hoping that your life path would bring unique quests and decisions outside of some dialogue choices. NPCs and story quests are memorable and the world building is excellent.\n\nHopefully they keep updating it and introduce big expansions like Witcher's B&W and HoS. Mike Pondsmith's Cyberpunk universe is worth it.",

Yes, but only because I paid for it, I dont think I can get a refund now, and Im off work at this point, so might as well continue playing it for a while until I cannot stand the bugs at all. I've also played worse....\n\nThe game breaking bugs include(but not limited to) sprites phasing through walls, doors, furniture, and even their own clothes. So far no audio issues and only one major crash(the first time the game loaded it crashed before it got to the main menu, but loaded fine the next time), but the visual bugs are incredibly distracting and I cant help but wonder if they are intentional comedic relief intended to lighten the mood.... still not sure.\n\nOther than that, the gameplay itself is decent and has potential and the voice acting is also fairly good, soooo.... Get it on sale.... is my advice..... But honestly $30(what I paid) is too much. This is more of a $20 sale item or preferably less. Devs need to pull their head out of their ass, fix their game, release an expansion to apologize to their fans, maybe more modding support, etc.... THEN maybe this game would be decent. They dropped the ball hardcore and really need to make it right before Ill give this game a thumbs up. \n\nAgain.... Yes.... Ill continue playing it because I've played WAY worse games, but some of those games turned around and made a really amazing product by listening to their fans.... This game has not done that yet, and might never do it at all....",

But it is still a good game with talent behind it. If you're a fan of anything Cyberpunk style, especially series like Blade Runner or Ghost in the Shell this game is a dream come true for you.

Enemies in the patch 1.5, became more realistic, getting cover, hiding themselves from the player, trying to survive in a combat. Their artificial intelligence became more accurate since the last patch.\n\nCampaign mode is absolutely rich in stories, characters, plot and gigs as they call third party missions. Johnny Silverhand follows the player throughout the game-play, and he becomes a part of us, that sometimes the player can think the same as he thinks about the future and Arasaka itself.\n\nI highly recommend for those who never had the opportunity to buy the game, since it seems that it's more polished than the old patch.\n\nI'm currently playing with my third character, started for the second time with Nomad.",

        "content": "Ok last review till next major patch, I have 10+ hours in the game now and my last recommendation stands.  Basically if you bought this for $30 you paid a good price and it's recommended.  Anything above $40 I wouldn't buy the game because in my honest opinion it's still in beta and you dear player are paying for the privilege of being a game tester to report their bugs.  I really REALLY wanted to just click the thumbs up button and delete my previous reviews b/c maybe I was too hasty but in the past 6 sessions (which accumulated my 4+ extra hours of gameplay) The following bugs have been found (with many more that I'm sure I forgot.  These are just the humorous ones that I remember)\n\n1: I accidentally hit a brown sedan and popped it's hood, all cars became brown sedans with their hoods popped (have screenshots) \n2: While driving on the bridge on my motorcycle thinking \"you know what this game isn't too bad I was wrong\" the bridge deletes itself and I fall through the world\n3: Bartender from afterlife offers me a ride back, I say \"no thanks\" she drives off well 50 feet or so, and then decides to un-merge with her car which drives 50 more feet, she's floating in the air and the car is just there for grabs.\n4: Accidentally rear-ended a truck today, merged with it due to wonky collision detection, the truck takes me for a ride till I can swing out from it on my motorcycle.\n5: Several quest bugs, thank god for forums and people who post helpful information.\n\nAgain as I've said in all my reviews I really really hope they keep working on this game, the story is engaging and immersive, the city is beautiful.  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI wish there was a neutral button on steam instead of just yes and no.  \n\n(short version) As the game is and at the time of review (6.5 hours of gameplay) I would not recommend.  There has been a lot done to this game, it has definite promise but it still feels far from completed.  I may look up some mods to try to add improvements until they hard code it. \n\n(long version) Game is still buggy, over the past 3 sessions I've experienced my car flipping like a gymnast in a tunnel without hitting anything, rare odd vesicle lag, and a few other minor bugs.  The world is amazing that can't be understated but it is so EMPTY there are (I think) literally thousands of shops nearly 100% of them have locked doors and are not of use.  It is a chore (wish I could underline chore) to find gun shops etc (at least from where I'm at in playtime) 3 weapons is just so sadly lacking especially if you're going to use a melee weapon.  I love love riding a motorcycle the control for it is just great... I hate my default car it drives like it's on ice and is just so irritating.  I hope they continue to improve this game because I can easily see it becoming a favorite but right now it has so much it can improve on.  \n\n----------------------------------1.5 patch initial review------------------------------------------- \nHOLY WOW... I don't know what they did with the update but it basically turned this game into a virus.  Game constantly was running on my computer for two days (I just bought it and only played for 2 hours) now I have 13 hours of game time.  If I didn't have a 5 min sleep timer on my computer this game would have been playing non-stop for a week.  After trying to 'actually' play the game today it would not launch and was stuck on \"update queued\".  After several troubleshooting attempts I just decided to uninstall the game... (short version) I had to restart everything just to be able to do it.  (long version) It wouldn't uninstall from steam, it had no processes running but was constantly running in the background (verified every time I tried to exit steam) the game didn't appear anywhere on any of my drives.  (Fixed it) Full shutdown required, and instant uninstall.  After a 2 hour re-install the game works again... I'll change my recommendation if no further issues happen in two weeks or so.",

I bought it on sale, but after playing over 30 hours with no sign of being near the end, I would gladly of bought it at full price. Cyberpunk 2077 checks all the boxes for a AAA title.",

PC Gaming is about pushing the hardware limits and despite its flaws, this game tried to do that then.\n\nUnfortunately, the developer decided to butcher the graphics quality in the recent 1.5 update. Whatever the settings, the game looks blurry and every surface looks like smooth plastic (the roads are particularly bad). Before that, you could clearly see close details from walls and objects, but not anymore. Everything looks blurry as you close in and it breaks the immersion, which was the main quality of the original game.\n\nThe \"next gen\" consoles are from 15 years ago in the PC world, and they shouldn't have degraded the PC version quality to please the owners of those overpriced living room heaters. One thing that those consoles could have brought is better parallelism, having 8 cores, but the game engine still use 2 or 3 cores at most, which is another fail.",

Not only am i waiting with bated breath for the expansion now, but the Netflix series reignited my desire to play the game. And it's even better than before. And yes.

Was it missing a lot of the promised features and story elements and mechanics? YES. Was it still a fun and meaninful game? YES. I did enjoy it, even on ps4, where there were a few bugs but nothing too terrible. a crash here and there and while that isnt becoming of a AAA game and a studio as loved as CDPR, it was still a fun game that provided me at least 200 hours of game play and warrented a 2nd purchase on pc. The imporvments have been hit or miss but i feel like its starting to shape up and there are some moments in this Story and Game that are unforgettable and excellent, haunting experiences that I will always be glad i didn't jump on the hate-hype train and miss out on completely. i look forward to seeing what happens with this game now that the Next-Gen patch has been launched and hope to see more and more improvments.",

The ending is like nothing I have ever seen. Just mindblowing.....  I feel REALLY sorry for the developers, that put so much effort into this amazing game, that Cyberpunk 2077 got such a bad start: The negative reviews posted around and after the publishing date combined with a high price tag also kept me from buying it when the game originally came out. I bought the game on sale last week for 29 euros and OH MY GOD this is a BARGAIN. Had the price been triple I would have gladly bought it as well - knowing what I know now. There are NO software issues what so ever. The game is extremely well optimized and runs flawlessly in an unprecedented graphics level on my vintage 2012 gaming rig.  I love titles like RDR2, Green Hell,  Tomb Raider, Metal Gear Solid, Kingdom Come: Deliverance, FarCrys, Assasins Creeds, Hitmen, The Forest, etc., So far RDR2 has been my all time favorite game - but the storyline and especially the ending in Cyberpunk 2077 is just even better. \nA BIG APPLAUSE for the developers behind Cyberpunk 2077.  This game totally exceeds my expectations and the current pricetag is ridicoulously cheap. 10/10. I really can't think of anything thats wrong with this game. Very highly recommended. I am overwhelmingly positive. Fantastic job by the developers.",

(combat is the bangers and mash of the game)\nits just a boring spray and pray shooter essentially\nthere's no incentive for being stealthy, crafty, or extremely efficient at killing... there's no 'fear' meter for enemies, every single mission area you enter ultimately is completed/cleared the same way... just kill everyone, the fastest way to do that is to get the biggest gun you have and spread that american freedom. its the fastest and easiest way to clear and complete an objective. there's no draw back or disadvantage by going loud and just sending everyone in the area to the afterlife.\nthe enemies don't call for back up, the police don't come to suppress the firefight... \nno bonus points for being sneaky as i said, no tactical advantages for using hacking or other unilateral interdiction tactic, there's no reputation mechanic in game so enemies are not intimidated or fearful of you.... depending on reputation or even fearful of the amount of cyber-ware enhancements you may or may not have... i think you all get the idea.\n\nunderneath all the shinny and amazing looking city/world.... its just a boring shooter wrapped in a RPG story line.\n\nother games that are years older have more player interaction , and react to the players actions and choices than this game does.\n\nthere are a lot of problems with this game, i have only mentioned 'some' of the bland issues with combat within mission areas... i didn't even mention how stupid it is when your walking down a street, casually exploring the city, walking past a couple of random gang members that are just standing next to a street light or in front of a shop... talking to one another, then they automatically start trying to kill you because you walked past them...\n\ndon't even get me started on that rediculousness.\n\nthis game needs to be fixed.... in reality it shouldn't have even been released when it did, it didn't even work on XBOX or Playstation at release if my memory serves.\nClearly this game was victim of board room politics and economics.... rushed to meet a deadline for release to turn a profit for the people that paid for its creation.\n\nI am getting over developers releasing games that are not finished and receiving money from there customers for a product that is no where near what was advertised.",

You will never be able to pick up everything and throw it around like in Valve's Havok engine. You will never be able to customize the vehicles like you can in Forza or play with the guns like you can in Metal Gear. You'll never be able to rearrange your apartment or build secret forts in alley ways. You'll never be able to design and position your own tattoos or color your clothes. All of the MMO-esque multiplayer-oriented social and immersive things I wanted Cyberpunk to have will never be there. That will always leave a sour taste in my mouth because I long for them every time I play.\n\nBut. If you DON'T care about those things, what's left is still good. The story, graphics, optimization, GUI, voice acting, length, guns, clothes, exploration, collection, audio (you get it). Everything that's not customization or immersion is great. While not revolutionary, what's left is a solid experience.\n\nUltimately it boils down to being an open world sci-fi loot n' shoot with a bitchin' story. The RPG elements, alternate story angles and mod support give it decent replayability, but singular map and story and barely any social or immersive \"extras\" there will inevitably be a point when the environment becomes stale and it will have to be shelved while we all go back to playing multiplayer games.",

Had some minor lighting glitches etc, sometimes had to go back few times to get some things correctly but other than that game ran perfectly for hours each session. Loved every second of it. Got nearly all endings and still gonna replay it.\n\nHaven't tested the 1.5 patch and the additional 10gb patch yet but gonna do it soon c:\n\nHaven't enjoyed a game so much like with CP77 since 2011-2012. Good job CDPR <3",

But much, much more special.\nCyberpunk 2077 is amazing in every detail.\n\nEspecially with the latest update, 1.5, Night City feels much more alive. The architecture, the population, the lights, the weapons, the vehicles,... Beautiful! I never tire of capturing the screen. It's a masterpiece.\n\nAnd the script? The amount of rich and intelligent content dialogue is unbelievable. Literally, you play a movie (or a parallel life o.O). The characters are so captivating, the reactions are so well done... there's no way you can't be impressed. And the romance then... hmm? ;-)\n\nAddictive! I just finished the main story, and I'm so freaked out that I want to play all the endings before I play normally again.\n\n\nThat's it!\nThis is a fan REVIEW! Of course the note is 10!!!\n\n[b]IMPORTANT: Cyberpunk 2077 played 100% on Linux!!![/b]\n\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1]REVIEW - Portugu\u00eas Brasileiro[/h1]\n---\n\n[b]UMA D\u00c9CADA SONHANDO COM O LAN\u00c7AMENTO DESTE JOGO![/b]\n\nA espera valeu a pena!\n\n\n\u00c9 como jogar Blade Runner. Mas muito, muito mais especial.\nCyberpunk 2077 \u00e9 incr\u00edvel em cada detalhe.\n\nEspecialmente com o \u00faltimo update, 1.5, Night City parece muito mais viva. A arquitetura, a popula\u00e7\u00e3o, as luzes, as armas, os ve\u00edculos,... Linda! N\u00e3o canso de capturar a tela. \u00c9 uma obra de arte.\n\nE o roteiro? \u00c9 inacredit\u00e1vel a quantidade de di\u00e1logos de conte\u00fado rico e inteligente. Literalmente, voc\u00ea joga um filme (ou uma vida paralela o.O). Os personagens s\u00e3o t\u00e3o cativantes, as rea\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o t\u00e3o bem feitas... n\u00e3o tem como n\u00e3o se impressionar. E o romance ent\u00e3o... hummm? ;-)\n\nViciante! Acabei de concluir a hist\u00f3ria principal, e estou t\u00e3o alucinado que quero jogar todas os finais antes de voltar a jogar normalmente.\n\n\n\u00c9 isso!\nEste \u00e9 um REVIEW de f\u00e3! L\u00f3gico que a nota \u00e9 10!!!\n\n\n[b]IMPORTANTE: Cyberpunk 2077 jogado 100% em Linux!!![/b]",

        "content": "I'm moving to night city.\n\nYeah, there's some funny bugs. It's really not that bad especially if you've played anything by bethesda. I'm nearly 40 and I don't think I've seen better writing than in this game, ever. Not just quality, but quantity. Feels like everyone has a story, even a random shop with no quest attached. And it's all VOICED, and voiced REALLY WELL. The city is ALIVE. Every single alleyway and building has a unique feel, and usually something going on. If my choices don't matter (and a lot of the time, they do), I can't tell. Every dialogue I choose or don't choose something feels like it has story-changing consequences even if it doesn't, a complete 180 from Fallout4's \"No\" option just being a sarcastic yes on the next line. \n\nAnd it's beautiful, and it's huge. And when I spend 10 minutes trying to figure out how to get on top of some geometry just for the scenery or fun of it- I find something! Usually not just trash either. It's fun to play, the missions don't railroad you into a style, the settings menus have so many options-- so much work has gone into this thing and it is very clearly there right down to the alley trash. If you can only see the negatives, please just compare this to the endless sea of shovelware by AAA studios that have come out over the past 5 years.  Cyberpunk 2077 is of a standard I've not seen in decades. Thank you",

I wanted to try that loader anyway so why not. \n\nIMO, the game was pretty good for the first couple of hours I played it. Not great, but pretty good. It does seem over bloated and so distracted on trying to be hyperbolic on the whole cyber punk shtick, that it gets lost on trying make a good game. It's just too much of everything. \n\nThe whole coming from nothing and being this respected mercenary/bounty hunter type role was pretty fun. But it was wasted with most of it being a montage. THAT should have been the whole game.But it seems they were so focused on trying to force Keanu Reeves into the game. I liked it less when he shows up. It just becomes another cliche early 2000's \"OMG everyone is after us and I'm going to die\" story. \n\nThe game-play, the world, the characters, the story, the side quests were just not worth the time investment for me. If you just want to raise hell and break everything while laughing at raunchy ads, then OK, you might like it. I seem to be in the minority of not liking it, but I just felt it wasn't very good. It was cliche and trying too hard to be unique instead of just being a good game.",

Found ways to argue out of glaring issues with controls, and frame timing and NPC glitches and TERRIBLE car handling characteristics and  falling through freeways and getting my first stuck in a wall and dying as a result of it. Growing pains, I said. Performance wasn't that bad, but that's coming from someone with a well above average rig (3700x/3080).\n\nGave up quite a few months go and told myself that I would return once the smoke had cleared on a few updates because I wanted to believe they would see the light eventually. 1.5 update drops and that's the moment I decide I will reinstall the game and give it a go with fresh eyes.\n\nLast two days I havent been able to launch the game, no matter what I try. I think it finally broke me, I'm uninstalling and committing it to a waste of 60 bucks.\n\nMy advice? You're going to spend a lot of time TRYING to love this game, navigating around technical issues that just suck the fun out of the experience.  If that's your idea of a good time - then have at it. But if you're an adult with ever decreasing time to game, and get intensely frustrated when your play windows are dominating with troubleshooting instead of playing, then do yourself a favor and and skip this one. At the very least, don't pay full price for it. I just... can't anymore with this game. Its like that breaking point moment in a relationship when you realize that issues you hope you could work past are simply too far gone.\n\n-------------\n\nUpdate:\n\nThe issue that prevented me from launching the game seems to be fixed. However, it is still very unstable. While it is running, performance/visuals have improved and there is a reduction in the graphical glitches and popups that plagued my first playthrough.",

        "content": "I usually don't write reviews but feel that since patch 1.5, I feel the need to write one. I want to express my dislike on the current CDPR's business model and end product.\n\nCP2077 was announced in 2013, entered pre-production stage in 2014 and production in 2015 assuming after the Witcher 3. I believe there must have been a big change to the development in 2017 after you (rather supreme leader Adam Badowski) spontaneously decided to cast Keanu Reeves (I don't blame you, he's a likable individual) as quasi the main protagonist in the game to the detriment of the player. I don't play tabletop RPG's but the main point of those RPG's is to have the character of the player to be on the forefront ! Or other players at least if it is a squad-based RPG. Didn't Mr. Pondsmith tell you that?\n\nWhat happens following the gameplay announcement in 2018 can be condensed in that sinking scene in the Titanic movie where the musicians keep on playing. You end up throwing away roughly 4 years of development just because Johnny F*cking Silverhand has to be a major plot point and cut down your time to 2 years to finish arranging the story around him.\n\nSince 2018, you ditched the concept of \"released when ready\" in favour of over-hyping, over-selling your game, to the point that even in my workplace people were aware of it, which doesn't have many gamers to start with.\n\nYour game released, I also was expecting a bit too much to be honest, but CP2077 was my first pre-order and even wanted to gift to a friend for Christmas. Fast-forward now and oh boy...\n\nAfter over a year of continued support on the game, you're better off pulling the plug and sell the rights to a studio that has the management, budget and experience to actually develop that kind of game (Rockstar comes to mind). I should have been more careful after your announcement in 2018 that you can't deliver what you promised based solely on your success of Witcher 3, which was the only title CDPR had a major success with.\n\nAfter Patch 1.5 I still have issues with CD: \n\n- Customize after character creation (basic feature present in almost any RPG/action/whatever game nowadays);\n- Cars are more \"driveable\", yes but can't change their colours, body, etc. (feature present in titles over 20 years old btw);\n- Minimap is still as bad as before;\n- New apartments to buy (yay I guess? But new mechanics, weapons, major gigs would have been better imo);\n- No communication whatsoever, either you over-mediatise your game, or you go full silent mode (?); you publish a roadmap and call it a day! That's not how you communicate with your customers if you're in damage control mode!\n- New story elements would have been cool, though you added some gigs;\n- Pacifica... Well, Pacifica is Pacifica. Still boring, unpopulated and has lower crime-rates than a max security prison on riot without guards. Which is supposed to be the toughest neighbourhood in Night City; \n- Where are the new gangs you promised as well? (The clown ones and psycho ones?);\n- No combat Arena;\n- No transit features either - Modders have done it already;\n- Badlands are as empty as my babushka's vodka bottle! (I believe Mitch or Scorpion state that the Badlands are actually full of dangers. We don't have the same notion of \"full\" I guess). Yes there are gigs and NCPD hustles here and there but there is no armed convoy from Militech, or hostile nomads, any sort of other activity...\n- No repeatable, radiant missions (gang shootouts, corpo assassination, etc.). Some like, some dislike them but I think it's a nice feature that could have been inside to get us to try different builds, because once you reach lvl. 50, you're more powerful than Chuck Norris, Jesus and Santa Claus combined, and at that point, you beat the game! Yes there are NCPD alerts but it is preset in defined places and pop-up occasionally only, so you have to actively go hunt them because NCPD doesn't have the coordinates of the different crimes unless you drive by them;\n- No New Game+;\n- Some bugs are still present (car rains down on road or is catapulted over the Pacific) but they are rather funny to me, and I'm on PC so I can't complain on that because my config is rather top-tier and the game is surprisingly stable for me.\n- Some perks got overhauled but as stated before, no concrete way to farm them or some are still not fixed (athletics, looking at you);\n- Minor complaint : no new clothes, no cyberware visual overlays, transmog, etc.;\n- 2 weapons added lately but still a low amount of choice. Status effects are locked to the weapon designer too, but I guess this can make sense lore-wise;\n\nBy trying to please everyone (Stadia, PS5, etc.) you end up pleasing no one. Design your products around fewer customer-bases and hardwares, then expand on it. You can expand on a success you developped for a niche, what baffles me is that the management in CDPR didn't take lessons from the Witcher 3's success (which is not my type of game) making the execs look like baboons squandering Polish government's and CDPR's investors' money away on \"gambling\" projects. CP2077 feels really like you gambled on making a big success and you chewed on more than you can bite.\n\nI may seem being too hard on them but the game was sold for nearly 70 USD in my country, and features that are considered as basic in most games took nearly one year to implement. So of course I'm not going to be pleased that easily, consumers should remember that they vote with their wallet!\n\nThis review is long enough as it is already, and just want to add that I feel bad for the employees that sacrificed and crunched in order to meet hallucinatory expectations from management and PR dept.\n\nEDIT: I still enjoy the game as underwhelming as it is but for anyone out there, decide carefully on what you want to buy from CDPR. I know I wouldn't put my trust in them again unless there is a big change in the management. They seem to turn the ship in the right direction but is still very late and trust takes time to build.",

It was a broken game that had so much potential. Now here I am, after they released the newest update. The game still isn't where it should be but they are slowly updating it and making it better than it was. The difference between release day and post 1.5 update, it's tremendous. Between the smoothness and NPCs, UI, the feel of the cars and mechanics of combat. Its getting better. However, despite the bugs then and now. Cyberpunk has one of the best story's in my opinion. I loved every second of the main story AND all of the side missions you can do. This game has so much to offer, but in its current state pick it up on sale",

As time has past it seems they are adding things to make the game more alive and enjoyable which I applaud however story-wise I wouldn't say this game has much replay value as there is no branching dialogue trees or major game changing choices. Thats not to say the story and characters are bad but they advertised branching dialogue trees. It is a great FPS RPG, but just know that about the choices. If they ever do add branching dialogue and actual choices I would say this is a no brainer buy if you are looking for a FPS RPG with a great story.\n\n",

        "content": "Been here since day 1, and I am someone who came from the PS4 version of the game. This has been quite the journey from its horrendous launch to where we are today. Ever since launch I have enjoyed the game, though I do acknowledge that it is completely unacceptable how this game launched, and no video game should launch how Cyberpunk 2077 did. I'd say that this game has been \"playable\" since its 1.3 updates, but it wasn't in a state where I could fully recommended this game to others due to it still being in a worst state than early day Skyrim or the likes. Now here we are, the 1.5 relaunch update has brought us the \"next gen\" update to the game. Whatever you want to actually call this update, it brings the soft overhaul to the game in terms of stability and actual feature and mechanics rebalance to make the game far better in its design, and thus making it feel better to play, along with its far improved stability. The game is now at a state where I could fully recommend it.\n\nThe game is still far from being perfect, as certain play styles far outclass other play styles in terms of combat, especially melee combat, as its still pretty stiff and a bit of a button masher at times. Content still feels weirdly distributed around the map with some areas being far more dense in terms of content than others. Any other complaints I have would just be nitpicking at the game really. \n\nThere is a lot to like about this game. The characters do feel genuine in who they are and what roles they play. The combat and stealth in most areas feels good or great mechanically and in execution. Traversing the world is never really a chore, given the amount of different vehicle types, the large number of fast travel locations, and general movement speed when on the ground thanks to the not terrible stamina amount you have along with the very basic parkour system you get access to. The decent variation in quests has a mix of combat, detective work, or even stealth retrieval, sometimes a multiple of styles. Depending on which skill tree you spec in, it actually changes a lot of how you approach each quest. You can go in stealthy, or go in guns blazing or fist swingin' if the quest allows for it. The driving was alright before the 1.5 update, but it is now incredible how much better it feels to control in the 1.5 update given the new types of driving options you have. There is a large variety of cars and motorbikes you can obtain too, and you don't even need to buy any to have good options. You can good a good selection of vehicles by just doing the main campaign.\n\nI really genuinely like this game, a lot. It is far from perfect, but it is really fun to play. If you were unsure about the game before, but were thinking about jumping in with this update coming out, you should play it. I highly recommend the game now. It is a lot of fun, and is now in a far more acceptable state now.",

I enjoyed it more on my second playthrough where I did much more of the side quest's and actually completed various side story missions that revolved around some of the people you meet.  There were too many thing's I didn't complete originally despite playing a reasonable amount outside of the main story, I just got to the point where I wanted to complete the story.  The writing is definitely there and really gives you some great missions.  I also like Johnny a lot more once I'd gone through his stuff fully.  Over all it's a game that had so much potential and you can see it as you go deeper in to it, it fell a bit short but I still play it because fundamentally it's a good game that you can have a good time sinking some hour's in to.",

        "content": "Despite all the problems this game had at launch, is it still worth it? Yes.\n\nThe storytelling in this game is amazing and truly immerses you in the universe. The writing of the characters you meet, and V themselves, is believable and feels in tune with the setting. You will come to care deeply about each of their fates, and struggle when you can't find perfect answers to everyone's problems. Its engaging, funny, cutting, and heart wrenching all at once. And in the end, you will have to find peace with the endgame path you take. Or, play the game again to experience them all! And you will want to, in no small part thanks to the gameplay.\n\nI can only speak for my own experience, but the gameplay is super punchy and really helps you build up to a power fantasy. At the start of the game you will be using cover and healing constantly, fearing to engaging in fights and being terrified of punching anywhere above your weight. Yet by the end, you will be leaping in against legions of forces with nothing but a pistol, popping off headshots and dodging bullets, as badass as Johnny Silverhand himself as the game slowly builds up the tools you need to gain that level of confidence. The guns feel incredibly good to use, and can be customised throughout to fit your playstyle. But there's also a whole path for those who prefer melee combat that i've yet to explore. But that's sure to be damn fun too wielding a Katana or cybernetic gorilla fists, or retractable mantis blades and mechanics for blocking, dodging and parries.\n\nThe level design must also be commended highly. Every mission and side quest has multiple approaches you can take. I played a high reflexes, cool charismatic character. This allowed me to talk or fight my way past scenarios others might be cautious to engage with. But there were many paths and routes blocked to me that could be dealt with by being a lot more muscular, or having a higher intelligence to hack past. Yet i never felt like i was being blocked from engaging, i just had to think my way around it and always the game delivers smart thinking. \n\nAll in all, this is a must buy for those who can run it. Its worth experiencing through in its entirety at least once, if only to see what somehow manages to be Keanu Reeves most emotive and interesting acting performance so far.",

In spite of this I've just ignored a lot of them and received a huge cyberpunk sci-fi experience.\n3. As an \"oldfag\" of sci-fi movies of 80th I've received incredible feelings. :D\n4. I finish game. Then I uninstalled the game. After that I was trying to choose the next game to play but I couldn't do this. As a result I've installed the Cyberpunk 2077 again and currently I'm starting the next new path right now :)\n",

I am just hooked on this game, tons of variety, you can get at the very least 3 different replays of the game before you get too bored thanks to the different paths and mission outcomes that are possible, similar to Mass Effect.  \n\nMy only complaint? Once you get anywhere near level 20 it can be a bit too easy with certain weapons and skills, even on max difficulty settings. I'm more in it for the story line anyway so it's not that big a deal. \n\nSome of the conversations with one of the main characters, Silverhand really gave me goosebumps as well, the sound design during those conversations/cut scenes can hit you pretty hard. \n\nIf you loved Skyrim, Fallout, Mass Effect, The Witcher, Dragon Age Inquisition etc, you'll definitely appreciate Cyberpunk, great value for money despite the god awful launch for console players. (or perhaps you might be one of those that had very high expectations for the game? I went in blind, purposely didn't follow any of the development so I was very satisfied with what I got)",

I was HYPED for this game before release, then never got around to buying it due to the bad reviews at launch. Picked it up on sale and am not disappointed.\n\nRunning a 6th gen i7 and a 1070, my laptop still holds it's own quite well performance wise. I have not noticed any technical issues or bugs.\n\nIt's a beautiful game, and so far has really sucked me into the world. Love it, can't wait to finish it on the go on my steam deck!",

The story is up there with Blade Runner and Akira (Even has the Bike!) From the city, to all the human interactions, the lights, the traffic, food carts.. Just Amazing at the amount of love and attention went into this game.\n\nIf you are like me and want a deep and engaging story, this is it! I was moved by the characters, the amount of emotions they were able to display was very touching! You will feel as if you're there in the world. That's what makes a game great! Thank you for making such a wonderful game.",

I am on the second path currently as a Nomad and I'm still discovering things I didn't do as a Street Kid. Cyberpunk 2077 is immersive, extensive and has riveting complex dialogue. The story line is impressive. Graphics are preem. Not to mention the screenshot feature is so cool to play around with. Sure there are bugs. Just open your last save (auto-saves every few seconds) and the bugs are gone. You wouldn't be a gamer if you didn't manually save before an important decision anyway. Highly recommend. I'm obsessed. 10/10 would spend eddies again.",

Taken for what it is, at a 50% discount, Cyberpunk  2077 is a good time (even with the buggy moments).",

I was one of the ones that wanted it from a long time ago, and naturally it wasn't what they promised but I'm pretty easy to please, admittedly. I like pretty graphics.  I went and got a 3070 just to play this game. One thing that makes games really good isn't the graphics or the story, but rather the connection between the action onscreen and your input device.  Done right, a game feels visceral and the blows punchy.  Some games have this in spades (like Dying Light) where the perspective combined with an intuitive control scheme and perfect response to your input pulls you in to the game, like you're not even holding a controller or using a mouse/keyboard. I like the feel of Cyberpunk in that respect.  Something about having the gorilla arms and savaging someone about the face with my bone crushing punches fills me with exultation. Helps me get rid of stress, I feel.  Plus, I mean, Keanu Reeves.  I'm straight but, damn... I know my wife would agree. I recommend reading through the cyberpunk TT game manuals that come with this game (yes, they're in the files if you look, in PDF form) - they help flesh out the world.",

I wish we could customise our character after making them, I wish we had some added perks depending on the background we chose but I understand why that wasn\u2019t included.\n\nOverall I\u2019m very happy I picked this up, I\u2019m in love with the city and all the different characters that I\u2019ve been meeting. The controls were simple to understand and the story whilst I get distracted quite easily (thanks ADHD) it\u2019s really engaging and I could very easy understand what was going on.\n\nAs for bugs, I\u2019ve not really stumbled upon any major ones, small glitches like calling my vehicle and it would sink in the ground a tiny bit but it wasn\u2019t noticeable. I\u2019ve only just started act 2 so it may be early days.\n\nI do recommend this game for anyone looking for a good open world game with good characters and stories to tell. If you\u2019re on the fence then I\u2019ll suggest picking it up on a sale but you should be fine :)",

Yes, apart from the bugs and glitches. I should say, the story is pretty short but personally I think it's amazing. The soundtracks are awesome! No doubt about it! The city itself is great! For someone who doesn't like open world games that much, I enjoyed it. I like the changes that they made. When I first purchased it, I regret it and wanted a refund. But it was a happy accident though.  Good thing I couldn't get a refund anymore so I played the game instead. Thought I might give this a chance. Nope. No regrets. I love this game. Despite the hate it gets. It's a good thing I didn't base my judgement of this game from the rants and hates. I've been seeing some good reviews as well. Devs are making an effort to fix the game anyway. One step at a time.",

        "content": "Honestly kinda fun. I don't feel ripped off, but I did buy the game at 50% off.\nSome parts of the game feel unfinished, or at least very sparse. Weapon customization is basically non-existant, crafting exists but is fairly pointless. Levelling some skills flies by, but others are painfully slow.\n\nEnemies animations can break if they are not on level ground, making them very hard to headshot or sometimes even hit. Luckily this doesn't happen too often. Items also sometimes get stuck on slopes/stairs, becoming unlootable. Sadly this is a bit more common. But honestly unless you go to sell after every bit of combat, you'll won't really care about most of the loot anyway, because your inventory will be full.\n\nWeapons, especially early game, increase in power rapidly, meaning there is little point to improving/crafting weapons, just pick up a better one. This is compounded by the fact that the cost of improving your guns damage increases seemingly exponentially, but the gun on the ground will still have 2-3 upgrades more dps at times without this added upgrade cost. Armor has a similar problem, but felt even worse for me since now I have to choose between dying faster or looking like a low level WoW character. And also the unique guns are generally massively better than anything else, so there's even less purpose to crafting. And you also are showered with healing items at every turn, so unless you are rushing into every combat headfirst and chugging meds nonstop you'll have lots. I think I had 150+ each of the first 2 tiers of healing items.\n\nThe story is decent, some of the characters are fun, but most of your playtime is likely going to be spent fighting random goons in the streets. But the combat is pretty good, so even just running around doing that is not bad. The enemy combat AI is dumb as bricks though, generally they just sit behind cover popping out one by one to take some potshots. If they do push on you its generally just one enemy who runs in the open to get gunned down, and their buddies just stay behind cover and watch them die. Generally deaths in combat for me happened from getting bored and running into a room with 4-5 people and trying to rush them without using cover. The AI may be stupid, but bullets do kill you.\n\nThe least satisfying part for me is driving. It could partially be because I am playing on KBM instead of a controller, but the cars handle terribly. I have to press the direction about half a second before I hit the corner, then let go about halfway through my turn. Because every car handles like a 300 foot long cargo ship. The motorbikes are a bit better, but still very slow to respond. I find myself running 500+ meters sometimes because I can't stand driving in this game. Oh and when you call for your car, they do love to cheekily run you over when you get near them. Even if they've stopped for a few seconds first, they sometimes randomly lurch forward to knock you on your ass and take a little bit of your HP.\n\nI didn't get pulled into the big hype for the game, so I am not as burned by the unfulfilled promises. But I would still say at full price the game is not super worth it, but at 50% off or better, it might be worth picking up.",

This is a good game, but it is not what is advertised. It's better to think of it as an open world first person shooter, rather than an rpg where your choices affect the story. This is a good game, but don't buy it based on the marketing or the steam page. Play it for an hour and a half, think about it, and refund it if you don't like it.",

        "content": "A complete mess of a game, but still fun.\n\nThe characters and the story are the strongest part. The main story is surprisingly short though, especially compared to the amount of sidequests. Exploring and doing all of these sidequests ruins the pacing of the main story, and defuses the sense of urgency that you're supposed to feel about V's situation. The main story is strong; the side stories are hit-or-miss.\n\nThe city I have mixed feelings about. It looks amazing and can be very immersive to walk around in, but upon closer inspection it ends up feeling empty and hollow. There's very little possible interaction with the environment, and it fails to convey the impression of a city that's actually alive and bustling with activity.\n\nGameplay is clunky. I tried a number of different playstyles, but eventually they all ended up as a mediocre shooter. Stealth and hacking are technically possible, but in practice neither viable nor fun, especially in the early game. There's a ton of unnecessary and confusing RPG elements thrown in the mix that could have easily been streamlined without detracting from the gameplay at all. Eventually I ended up just mowing everyone down with a katana, which was at least somewhat satisfying. Enemy AI is a joke. Driving is just \"meh\". Every room you enter has a million things to pickup (often trash) and every enemy drops a bunch of loot, making your inventory a complete mess if you're not constantly managing it.\n\nBugs... I played on 1.31 exclusively and I did not run into any major gamebreaking bugs. Instead, there were many, many minor glitches, mainly involving perplexing AI behavior or the physics system spazzing out. Some of them were quite funny, provided you don't take the game to seriously or hope for any real immersion.\n\nPerformance was fine, but then again I do have a beef PC that far exceeds the recommended requirements.\n\nOverall, it feels a lot like unrealized potential. But it does have a strong story, interesting characters, and a gorgeous city to explore. I never went very far on the hype train for this game, so it wasn't that difficult for me to just enjoy it for what it is right now. It can be good fun, just not always in the way the developers intended.",

It has very interesting storyline, I really enjoy it. Night city is huge, I was so amazed how big it actually is.. There is so much effort put into this game. I wish they waited one more year before releasing..\n\nAre the bugs still around?\nYep, however I did not encounter anything omg/critical/blocking so far. Most of the bugs are cosmetic, related to textures/weird movements of npc's, some bugs that you get stuck in the doorway and need to run and slide to get in.. but this is not a huge problem I'd say it's kind of funny when happens.\n\nIf you are playing Female V and decide to romance [spoiler]River[/spoiler] then at some point you won't be able to call and talk to him, he just hangs up on you. Nothing really happens tbh which is a shame.\nAnother bug was related to a vehicle (Caliburn) - after acertain mission car gets stuck and won't drive anymore, only wheels turn. Nothing helped - re-summoning, switching, fast travel etc so I found out that you can 'reset' Caliburn by shooting at it and exploding, and then re-summoning (you'll also pay 100g).

It's been more than a year since the game come out. I refuse to believe your team spent over a year just fixing bugs. That would be embarrassing. \n\nWe want more interactivity, more customization (hair salons, plastic surgery), better AI, better police (car chases), expanded romances, with options to actually interact with them at our apartment and in the city. Why can't we invite the romance option to our apartment to shag? Or kiss them or hug them or do ANYTHING with them after their quests are completed!? They all just stay in their apartment or camp, and repeat the same few lines of dialogue. Give us a more interactive Night City. Let us actually sit and order food at restaurants with animations... you know, like those that ALREADY exist in the game. Let us go to night clubs and sit and have a drink, let us interact with dancers at strip clubs. Let us have those one night stands you talked about years ago and showed in the E3 gameplay reveal. Let us interact with furniture more. Let us sit on chairs, benches, let us lie on our bed without having to go to sleep. Give us a lot more MEANINGFUL side quests, with branching stories and the ability for us, the player, to influence the direction of those stories, and fewer boring \"gigs\", the ability to purchase more apartments etc etc etc.\n\nNext, do SOMETHING to fix the HORRIBLE pacing and the irritating sense of urgency. \n\nAfter the mission to rescue Sandra, have Jackie just text us the next morning telling us that he returned the car to us, and then just let the player decide when they want to call Jackie. Maybe I don't want to meet him the very next morning. Maybe I want to explore that first part of the city for a few days, and then call Jackie after like a week. This leads me to my next point: \n\nLET US REFUSE TO ANSWER PHONE CALLS! What's the point of giving us the 'answer' button, when we MUST answer each time!? Let us refuse phone calls, and then later call the NPC at OUR convenience.\nHave the NPC/Companion/Fixer etc. call us, and if we refuse, they can just send us a short message saying \"Call me back when you have the time.\" Maybe I want to call them in 2 days. This would fix A LOT of pacing issues, and not make the player feel so stressed out, like they always have to rush and do these jobs quickly.\n\nI was barely able to explore the city, without feeling stressed out, because I had these urgent jobs and the YOU KNOW WHAT from the main quest always pressuring me. Like, I never felt right just exploring, knowing what was happening to V. I knew that I should not be prancing around a beach, when I had the URGENT main quest to do. Ignoring it felt stupid.\n\nNext, fix the way we interact with Johnny. After that first night when he reveals himself to us all angry, he and the player are in A REALLY bad relationship, right? So, then the very next morning we get a phone call from Goro to meet him at that diner. If we go there, the convo we have with Johnny flows natural and V is angry and mistrustful towards him. However, we also get a call from Delamain that same morning to go get our car. So, if we go do that first, V talks to Johnny like they are already friends, which is super immersion breaking. Fix that somehow. Let Johhny start appearing only after we've done the first few main quest missions or something.\n\nAlso, I don't know if it's just me, but the journal in this game is terrible. It's close to being useless. Like, most of the time it doesn't even tell you what the mission is, who gave it to you, or why you need to do something. It just has some clever little monologue by Jackie or Johnny. So, if you decided to leave some mission for later, then, when you finally decide to do it, but you've forgotten what it was about, chances are that the journal will tell you nothing useful. Rewrite that, if you can. \n\nMan, I could rant for hours. Oh yeah, expand on those few endings that are such obvious cliffhangers. Give us at least ONE good one. Man.",

Obviously collisions and physics is supposed to shut off when a machinema is started, however, the level design in this game alone is worth the price of admission.  When I first started the game I was like.  WOW!  This is so detailed!  But small... Then I started noticing the multiple levels of the city and how buildings have these back alleys that lead to entirely different areas wrapped within each other.  Then I finished the first story arch and about five times more city opened up and became accecssible and each area has a  different character to it like when I went out to L.A. years ago.  Some areas even reminded me of Cleveland and Pittsburgh.  This whole game is massive and so lovingly crafted.  I'm SO blown away!  I do think the AI and stories could use some improvement they're a little too passe and predictable even for Cyberpunk.  The mocap and acting is all pretty great and the scripts are fairly natural and believable for the most part.  The character Jackie was a bit stereotypical and annoying but oh well.  I hope the game company is able to keep making updates to the game.  I'd hate for this massive city to slowly die, its such a great investment and a wonderful stage to work any number of stories from.\n\nThank you everyone for all your hard work bringing this world to life.  Cyberpunk is one of my favorite genres and its needed an infusion of high quality new life for so long!",

But just because it's not for everyone doesn't mean its objectively bad.\n\nYes, there is no escaping the fact that the game is patchy, rough around the edges, and requires more interactivity and content, period. Yes, there are promises CDPR made that they did not deliver, for which they should absolutely be held accountable. Yes, you have to rely heavily on the modding community to prop up what they can until the devs release more updates.\n\nBut if you can look past all that (and I know that's a tall order) there is something downright magical about this game. I play games predominantly to experience their stories, and Cyberpunk boasts one of the most beautiful, emotional, mature stories of the last decade. I'm talking characters that put Mass Effect to shame. I'm talking atmosphere that puts S.T.A.L.K.E.R. to shame. I'm talking a soundtrack that... well, it at least gives DOOM a run for its money. And I say that as a diehard fan of all three of the above mentioned! This game breathes life into a world that I simply cannot get enough of, that I keep coming back to no matter how many bugs I have to fight through on the way. Not since the original days of Bioware has a world and its lore and its characters felt so mesmerizing.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 at its worst is not great. Sometimes it's downright bad. But Cyberpunk 2077 at its best is not just good. It's breathtaking.",

Loading issues, shader issues, mission bugs, and quite a few more that could be listed but i want to keep this short. I mean CDPR NEEDS to fix this game. I love the story and i want more from this game but I'm stuck thinking about the bugs and how it hinders the game from truly becoming a great title in gaming history. The story is great and the immersion into this world is addicting. Truly this game could be the best damn game of the 2020's but falls short dude to game breaking issues. I mean i have a higher end pc and should have no issues and its all due to the game engine and stability of the game. i love the interactions you have with all the characters and want more and deeper connections. i almost quit playing due to the first big fixer mission always crashing!! the big cinematic mission that starts it \"all\" and CDPR can't even get this engine stable. CDPR FIX THIS GAME. i have 60 hours into this at time of my review and i want bug fixes now.\n",

        "content": "I stayed away from this for a year, hoping that CDPR would fix most of the bugs and performance issues that plagued the game at release. I also recently got a 30- series RTX card and, wow, this game is beautiful - the city they've created is truly astonishing. It gets that sense of stacked verticality that most open world games set in cities really struggle to reproduce. The atmosphere is incredible. It feels worthwhile to explore every corner, Yes there are still bugs, yes the illusion isn't perfect, but it reminded me of the feeling of freedom I got when I first played Deus Ex back at the turn of the century.\n\nEDIT after around 40 hours played: I would still stand by most of this. The city they've created is something to behold in terms of atmosphere, sound and visuals. HOWEVER, a word of caution that the bugs are still common and over time they DO disrupt the illusion the game creates. I still regularly see car bodies disappearing and people happily driving around a chassis with wheels, or people glitching through objects, or buddies you're doing quests with getting stuck on tables and the like. \n\nThere's also the exploration... While you're doing quests it absolutely feels worth exploring every nook and cranny. But when you're back in the open world you rapidly realise that most of the buildings are empty facades. I get that they couldn't make an entire explorable city but unfortunately you'll very quickly not bother exploring Night City and simply go from point A to B to complete the next quest. Sure there are occasional things that happen as you're travelling around (assault in progress, gang fights and the like) but beyond that it's honestly not massively different from, say GTA 3 or 4. \n\nHaving said all that the side quests are varied and generally well-written - as has been said many times before they're honestly often more engaging and surprising than the main questline. There's one I did recently with River Ward about kidnapped teenagers which made use of braindance, investigating crime scenes, collecting evidence... AND actually made a difference depending on what skills you'd invested in. It also didn't end up in a firefight where you gradually whittle down bullet-sponge enemies.\n\nAll in all, it's still a recommendation for this game, just a qualified one. Try to get it on sale if you can.",

The only think I am in a weird place about is the end game.  I both hate and like how they make it so you can continue to play after you beat the game.  You continue by playing the save just before you hit the last quest chain which allows you to do all the endings without starting a new character but also makes it so you don't play a game where your actions really mean anything in the long run.  If they were to make a DLC where you play the character after, in the time line, you beat the game I would be much happier.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 is a great game, ripe with flaws and bugs but the positives heavily outweigh the negatives. This review won't focus solely on why it's great, but why some people hate on it.\n\nExhibit A, Post launch consensus. The launch of this game was disastrous, it was crawling with bugs and performance issues, I had a mid-high specs PC at the time and the game would fluctuate from 20-40 fps at medium settings, only being playable at low settings at 30-40 fps. Since then the game has changed, a lot, the major bugs have been ironed out and the performance is night and day, I upgraded to a new PC and the game runs at a constant 60 fps (I have it capped, it goes up to 70-80 fps but I prefer a stable 60) at max settings, my old PC runs the current game at 50-60 at high settings and around 30-40 at max.\n\nExhibit B, Post launch \"reviews\". When the game first launched it was hit by a wave of angry reviews, and most of which were angry for good reason, but with a big following comes a big responsibility which many big reviewers refused to bear. Many big reviewers complained about how the game was too short and lacked content, those same reviewers then stated that they played none of the side missions which make up around sixty percent of the game. If you have played The Witcher 3 (W1 and W2 don't apply here, their side missions aren't as integral) you would know that some of the side missions are integral to the story, in Cyberpunk this is more so the case, the side missions are completely essential and a reviewer should review the entirety of the game's content, not a third of the game's content.\n\nExhibit C, Gameplay expectations. Cyberpunk is an RPG, not the best one but a step up compared to many modern RPGs, this is coming from an avid RPG fan with hundreds of hours on Deus Ex and well over a thousand hours on TES:3 Morrowind, those are what I could think of at the top of my head. Some people were coming into Cyberpunk expecting a classic RPG, if you have played any of CDPRs other games you'd know that that is certainly not the case, it's a much more modern RPG which I certainly don't prefer but the game was never supposed to adhere to the hardcore RPG crowd. Most people went into Cyberpunk expecting GTA5 with more colours, they were also disappointed because the game was far too complex and non linear when compared to a very linear, laid-back game such as GTA5 and disliked the combat because they couldn't make a proper build.\n\n\nReview:\nCyberpunk 2077 is a strong title only being held back by the lack of polish and unfulfilled potential, this game had the potential to present many unique concepts that aren't really explored much, ranging from simple concepts that would have been cool to see such as fully six dimensional movement in vehicles and third person perspective, to more impactful gameplay features such as heavier emphasis on world interactions such as trade, industry and transport, a reputation system that carries onto the interactions with specific factions and finally and most disappointingly, an actual faction system. \n\nWhile Cyberpunk is certainly better than the majority of games out there today, most of which are compilations of \"unique\" ideas that don't really go anywhere and are most likely derivative of an older title that is infinitely better (I'm not-so-subtly referring to all the max payne rip-off shooting galleries and all games in a similar vein) and is a step up from the increasingly popular extremely linear structure of gameplay and narrative present in many games and on the other end of the spectrum, the structure-less design of other open world games, it falls short from the potential it had, this game could have been a lot better and the more you play it the more it shows. \nThe game has been fixed but Cyberpunk's greatest issue (especially on pc since it wasn't as dramatically bugged at launch as the console version) remains to be it simply not being finished. The game was \"technically\" in development for eight years since it was revealed in 2013 and released in 2020, a logical estimation would be that development started in 2012, but the actual development time was only a little over a year since the project was repeatedly scrapped, meaning the Cyberpunk 2077 that was released is not the same game CDPR planned on releasing initially. This meant that many gameplay features and planned ideas were never completed and were thus simply cut from the game completely.\n\nConclusion:\nCyberpunk 2077 is a fantastic game and the backlash and hate the game faced may not be what the game or the devs deserved, but it is certainly what the corporate side of CDPR deserved for publishing the game when it was so clearly unfinished. I commend the devs that have been patching the game since launch, the contrast between launch and now is truly night and day. I also want to give praise to the modding community, there are some absolutely fantastic mods out there, even if you're not a fan of RPGs and want the combat to be less focused on RPG mechanics there's even a mod for that, mods are adding and refining many aspects of the game and the community has grown to the likes of that of Bethesda's titles.\n\nRating: \n-8/10\n-Fun gameplay\n-Fantastic graphics\n-Interesting story and compelling characters\n-Banger soundtrack",

Unfortunately the only bar it has uped is on the graphics standpoint, if you want a myriad of legitimate choices in your game, an alive environment, story and characters you remember for the rest of your life, this aint it, but, as much as it shit the bed on its launch, the devs are devoted to getting this game in a better state, but they are being VERY slow on that front. \n\nI still would recommend the game if you want a solid single player experience, and hell, it could be alot more than that if a couple of years time.",

There are still bugs, and the Devs do have a while to go, and a bunch of patches to let out to fix the bugs. But that's any game nowadays, over promised and underdeilvered. The Bugs didn't stop me from playing, or halt any progress. The game is very much playable in this state! And don't think I am saying that it's a bad kind of playable because the bugs that I have run into are an easy player fix, Leaving the Area and coming back, Or just waiting.\n\nBut the way V interacts with the other Characters, the Voicelines, the gun play, and the sheer size of the map is awesome. Voice lines are very well done, The Gunplay is awesome and there's so many combanations you can use! The way you build you're character is also pretty cool. You can make a Fist Fighter, a Cyber Ninja, hell My buddy built V so that is was a QuickHack only build. Went through pretty much the entire game barely using any guns.\n\nIn Short, Solid Story, Solid Gameplay, Still Kinda Buggy, But for sure 100% Playable",

Why the hell would you do that? You don't nerf gear in solo games. You only do that crap for game balance in MMO and PvP games. That was a true knucklehed move.\n5. RIDICULOUS: You overbuffed MaxTac and Border Patrol so much they dodge every bullet if you have agro'd them. \n\nNumber 4 has ruined the game for me. As I said below, I've completed it multiple times already, and there is no infinite playability because fixers don't generate random missions - once you finish their mission queues that's it; and standard mobs and mob hideouts/dungeon crawls don't respawn. So messing with NCPD MaxTac, and Border Patrol were the only remaining fun. EXTREMELY disappointed. Time for me to uninstall. >:-(\n\n***ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW***\nI have played through Cyberpunk 2077 four times, male and female, all three character choice types (Nomad, Street, Corp), and each available ending. I like the gameplay mechanics, the city and story are really really good. The music kicks ass! However, as a player of the original pen-and-paper Cyberpunk 2020 and Night City this is based on... this ain't Cyberpunk 2020.\n\nWhat I think they got right::: Combat feels very balanced, and the variety is good (melee, ranged, etc.) (though I wish you could hire NPC henchmen and build a team that can level with you - netrunners for overwatch, solos, snipers, etc.). Weapons selections, and mods are excellent. Vehicles are fun - though I find motorcycles are most efficient for travel. Scale (the game environment is HUGE). Ambiance and environment can get really immersive.\n\nWhat I think was okay, but could have been much better::: Interpersonal relationships. Don't get me wrong the main NPCs are outstanding. The movement, script, etc. - great. But the people on the street? not much there. There were definite opportunities for the developer to integrate enhanced relationships with various NPCs - Rogue, and many in the merc underworld; The Us Crack girls; Jefferson Peralez the mayoral candidate (his quest reached a climax, and then just quits - very disappointing). Cops? No sources of intel/friends on the force to speak to for info on gigs, personalities, or other info. The Talent/Skills trees are okay. Too many skill bonuses to select from only enhance combat capabilities when you are doing special actions like slides, and melee functions that don't really match my play style. In general the Talent/Skill system is good though, and does make a difference for many needed functions like hacking, crafting, and others.\n\nWhat I think they got wrong::: Fixers. Mission assignment. no Infinite playability. Lack of character customization - No ability to visit a salon and change a hairstyle, or get a tatoo. No ability to alter the physique of your character - on the female character you can change the breast size, but that's it. The male character can change penis size... really? That was necessary? I've played over 250 hours and those features are needed maybe 2 minutes on screen; and the clothing system? Really? Especially for the outfits you craft yourself - you should be able to pick the colors. Can't believe I can go to a high-society corp clothing store and spend $3000.00 on a shirt, but can't pick the color of the cloth.\n\nCyberpunk 2020 was about immersive role playing. Going to the fixer locations, negotiating your price, building a team, developing enemies (watch your back), and allies and sources for intel and gear, as well as fixer missions, and growing your rep with factions.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a very playable, and fun game, but would benefit greatly from a better mission system, respawning mobs, and random/infinitely spawning player-leveled side missions and gigs. I have played every side mission, every gig, bought every car, and finished every NCPD and other on-map alert and there is literally nothing left to do but cruise around hunting gangers, and screwing with Arasaka, Militech, and NCPD MaxTac. ...and WHY don't MaxTac mobs drop gear? Same for the border. No drops?\n\nI'll keep playing it, because I like it, but I'm praying for some serious DLC coming soon, and some game mechanics fixes to allow greater infinite playability.",

There were times when the gameplay did get a bit repetitive, but the story was everything I could ever ask for from a sci-fi thriller. This game is a roller coaster of emotions and I think its time for me to get back on for my forth ride.",

        "content": "I just downloaded and started playing CP2077 a few weeks ago and I'm totally hooked.  Apparently I missed the rocky phase of the release and started at patch 1.31, which I believe has significantly reduced the level of frustration earlier adopters experienced.  In keeping with the high bar set by Witcher 3, the game is well crafted, intermixing a powerful and complex story line with a broad variety of side missions which help the player to gradually build their familiarity with the game mechanics while developing their skills and refining their combat techniques.  \n\nThis is a complex game, with a wide variety of settings to pick from.  There are skill-tree decisions and story line options that can potentially change future outcomes and endings.  For some, the complexity will enthrall and for others it will be a turn-off.  This isn't really a hack and slash game by design.  To enjoy the entirety of the game ecosystem, it will be beneficial for you to have a more cerebral play style, but there are provisions for you melee types as well.\n\nIf that's your thing, you can always play \"John Wayne\" style and approach each confrontation with guns blazing and swords slashing.  There is a whole build type called \"Sandevistan\" to support that mode.  IMHO you will miss out on a lot of the nuance designed into the game, which combines elements of stealth, strategy, melee and weaponry but that's a personal choice that is nicely supported.  There was a lot of thought that went into the weapon upgrade and random drop logic to prevent out of level scaled damage.  This helps keep the combat challenging and engaging.\n\nDon't expect everything to be spelled out for you.  There are some key gaps with respect to providing a basic understanding of the play mechanics of weapons and cyberware.  You WILL get the basics and you should expect to learn the fine details from actual combat/gameplay, supplemented by input from forums, etc.  There are some clunky bits in the UI, like how to find quest based shards and how to manage inventory or apply mods.  There's no way currently to flag your weapon favorites to prevent them from being sold or scrapped out of your inventory, which can be frustrating when you are selling off the HUGE amount of low level weapons you accumulate as part of each combat operation.  There are a hundred different types of food and drink, but all with the same stats, which is a lost vendor/crafting opportunity.\n\nCP2077 is visually stunning, particularly at ultra rez.  Clever attention has been paid to the visuals and audio queues, with an absolutely amazing complexity of detail.  NPC movements, reactions and even the ubiquitous (and often humorous) presentation of graffiti are presented.  There are even a few cars with one headlight out because yeah... people still don't pay attention to their rides even in 2077.  Also be warned that there is a lot of sexually suggestive graphics/content and a LOT Of F-bombs flying around.  2077 is a raw place sex, guns and drugs and street violence are the norm and victimization is part of the story line.  I find it adds a level of \"realism\" to this dystopian vision, but if you find that offensive... don't even bother with this game.\n\nBottom line:  If you like a complex game with a gritty and amazingly detailed playing field, aren't squeamish about mature topics and are ready to enjoy a complex, evolving action packed story line, give Cyberpunk 2077 a try.  Now.. where was I......*Opens Journal*",

Yes, bugs do exist and they can be annoying at times but the story of the game is so worth it!

I spent a lot of time exploring and trying all the different options. Do yourself a favor and bump up the difficulty it does make it more satisfying as you progress the game gets a lot easier a little too easy towards the end. Graphically if you have the right system ray tracing on or off it looks good so 1080 I'd say go for it. Driving could be better but sometimes it's fun just to drive through the city and look at all the scenery. Riding motorcycles is the most fun in my opinion and it's one of the few times you can see your character. The biggest disappointment with this game is knowing what it could have been.\n\nGripes: It would be an all time great game if they just finished it. Most annoying issue is that it is often difficult to lock onto objects when picking up an item. This is such a basic game mechanic and it's the kind of feature you don't think of as a feature till some messes it up like this.  T-poses I can live with it's random and not much of an issue for me but the glitches did make some serious moments laughable. It's hard to know how much more I'd have enjoyed this game if it wasn't breaking up some pivotal moments.\n",

In Cyberpunk, The sea is highly polluted after the nuclear war. So, It is toxic remember? Therefore, devs didn't much care about the physics.

        "content": "OK, it's going to be a long one. So I bought this game, one year after the whole release drama. I thought some time had passed and some hotfixes and patches were released, so i said to myself \"let's give it a go.\"\n\nFirst of all, I recommend this game. I'm not one of those guys that plays a game for 100+ hours and says the game is not good. But let's make something very clear: it's January 16 2022, and to this day, the game is a big mess.\n\nFor starters, this game does 2 things very well: tell a story and build an immersive world. That's pretty much it, that's the whole 2 reasons why i think this game is great and you should play it. Forget about if this game is an RPG shooter or an open-world game, that's secondary. Let me explain myself:\n\n1. It's narrative is amazing. Side stories, main missions, lore, everything is told in a fascinating and appealing way. The game sets the mood for some really grim situations. That's what I'm saying when I told you this game can tell a story. A matter that is directly related to this is the quality of the main story. I'm no writer, but I can say I liked the overall story, but this is something I would put to debate; whether this game has a good story or not. It's the way this game presents it and evolves it that makes it an enthralling experience.\n\n2. The level of detail of this world is confusing. Because it's interactivity falls short against the overall design and art concept. The world is beautifully crafted. Design of buildings, clothes, vehicles, guns, products, it's all amazing. Soundtrack is out of this world, graphics quality is incredible. It really creates an immersive world where you really feel a part of night city, but then again interactivity is quite poor.\n\nIn terms of game mechanics, it's not there yet. The lack of classes makes it messy, gunplay is the most attractive feature of combat and stat leveling really feels lackluster. It just feels like a very fun pew-pew game. And that's a good thing, really. \n\nCustomization is a huge problem, basically because at the time is non-existent. You can't change styles of clothes, or cars, or guns, or anything really, so that's a huge let down.\n\nI think the RPG gameplay and the lack of customization is what exposes the real problem of the game. We all know about it's buggy and glitchy state, but if we take that out of the way and see the game for what it is, you can realize that the big problem with this game is it's confusing classification. It's not really an open-world game like others (GTA, Red Dead, Saints Row, you know the bunch) and it's not really an RPG. CDPR made a very ambitious game, and like I said, it's a fun, enthralling and nerve wracking experience, but it's not as interactive as an open-world game or as mechanically deep as an RPG. Still, gunplay is actually great, so you can't really delve so much on it's gameplay problem because it's not that big of a deal.\n\nSo I really recommend this game, i really think it's a next gen game and I encourage you to play it because you'll soon find yourself obsessed with it's narrative, it's fun combat and amazingly crafted world... when bugs are not still a big issue. I powered through the whole game getting constantly heartbroken at the numerous immersion breaking bugs or glitches, because let me promise you something, you will find bugs and glitches, and they will ruin your experience. I'm certain of it.\n\nSo yeah, make yourself a favor and play this game... once it's patched and fixed a little bit more.",

Some of the stuff that you can find out through playing and exploring is absolutely horrific.

I think some gigs where altered to not include Jacky anymore. So I hope that they will make some serious changes in the start of the game so we can have a bit more interaction with Jacky. I mean the game has a freaking funeral mission for him. But we only get to play 3 gigs with him! How are we supposed to feel a connection here ... .\n\n",

Even if the dates started getting pushed back, and then finally the game came out in December 2020. I was gonna get it like the day after it released, but didn't gladly. Heard the issues with the game around the internet, and I thought to myself that it can't be that bad. (of course it was a buggy mess.) But, just decided to wait for about a year, since CDPR was going through patches. Then witnessed the game have a sale of about $10. So I decided to give it a shot. \n\nI could say right now, that this is one of the most fun games I've played this year despite the many complaints. There was only a small amount of bugs through my gameplay, but were easily fixed through the modding community. So right now in 2022, I would recommend waiting for the future DLC, and bug fixes. \n\nI would totally recommend getting this game on sale, saves you some money.\n\n*DLC better be good, that's all I'm saying* \n\n- Azoozapple",

But overall the game is still very buggy, mostly small visual bugs that are a slight annoyance. The next thing I want to bring up is the story... the story is one of the best most \"real\" I have experienced from any video game. I would buy this game for the story alone, not for the beautiful graphics or exciting gameplay or the for the \"memes\". I don't think you can say this game is meme-able anymore. Now the final thing. The price... for me personally I would buy the game no matter what price, overall Cyberpunk 2077 isn't a game it's an experience. I guess you could say I had a positive experience. 100/100 would recommend.",

The $60 price tag is far too high for some of the issues/glitches in the game.\n\nI enjoy the game and the story so far. However, there are obvious glitches that appear each time I boot up the game to play. It's hard to go 15 minutes without seeing some kind of visual bug or glitch (T-posing NPCs, delayed texture loading, etc). I'm surprised that these issues that were in the game at launch are still in the game.\n\nThere are several things in the game (or not in the game) that disappointed me when I found out abut them. Vehicles are not customizable (bummer), the driving mechanics are fairly poor (if feels like you're driving on ice sometimes), and some areas are soft-locked due to the player's level (power enemies essentially lock you out of an area until you are ready, but the game doesn't readily tell you this until you get insta-killed by them). The police AI is also severely lacking and sometimes Night City feels just kinda... empty. \n\nThat said, I love the combat in the game, there is ample customization/crafting options for weapons/armor, and the story is good (so far in my play through). \n\nOverall, this is worth a buy, but only at a steep discount. Do not pay full price - you will be disappointed. I got Cyberpunk 50% off during the Christmas sale. If I had paid any more than that I would have been disappointed and may have gotten a refund. This is a $30 buggy/early access game being marketed as a $60 AAA game.",

        "content": "if i were to of reviewed this a month after release, i wouldve told you to stay away from the game until they completely overhauled the game. but since then, they have been working hard to make it immersive and of course there are still bugs, but i have not noticed anything that crashes the game that bad. i know a lot of people complain about bugs, but thats half the fun. when you walk around the city for hours and then randomly find an enemy stuck inside a tube that moves with them, i understand why people get mad, but CMON thats funny af. if you are planning on buying this game for gameplay alone, it can be lackluster as you really need to try and NOT put points into anything that gives you more damage. but the game is so story rich and wacky, that it is definitely worth picking up and putting hours into. just dont expect it to be perfect cause no game is. this couldve ended up like Anthem, but they are dedicated to making this fun and i respect that they didnt just give up on it. my final note would be performance, it definitely can tank a lot of gpus but its so much more playable now, if they didnt work on peformance, this would be a no-go",

        "content": "Vanilla Cyberpunk: 8.5/10\nModded Cyberpunk: 9.5/10\n\nIn its own way, Cyberpunk is a genuinely great game. Unfortunately, because it looks like any other crime-based open world game, it's easy to compare it to superficially similar franchises like GTA and conclude that the game *isn't* that great. I can sympathize with that point of view. NPC and driving A.I. are somewhat simplistic, there still isn't much customization or stuff to interact with in the city in the way of mini-games or other typical open-world time wasters, and there are still some bugs here and there.\n\nWhat makes the game special is its depth and maturity as a narrative experience. This is a narrative-driven game through and through that just so happens to exist in an open-world city. If you can divorce yourself from the duplicitous marketing and play the game as it is best played - as someone role-playing an existential crisis of their mortality amidst struggles with relationships and the self in desperate times - Cyberpunk is beautifully haunting. Quests are quirky and varied and intelligently confront so many different themes like personhood, PTSD, loneliness, freedom, depression, suicide, rape, and murder, and choices feel like they have emotional weight even if they don't alter the trajectory of the main story as overtly as choices did in Witcher 3. The voice acting and character writing are significantly more interesting and nuanced than most games can ever claim to be. Characters feel and act like multi-faceted people instead of just cliches. Even small bits of dialogue feel compelling instead of the typical perfunctory exposition so many other games deliver.\n\nThis game is also under-appreciated for how much poignant philosophy it includes; there are so many easily missed, fascinating details about corporate imperialism and its tools of technological determinism for what it means to self-identify as a person and live a meaningful life. Details in various forms across the city concerning the alienation, violence, and consumerism of a society in decay  create a blend of dark humor and real despair as you play the game. Every time you bother exploring the crevices and corners of the world, the game rewards you with more depth in its lore. Everything from written shards explaining people having 80-hour work weeks to news programs mentioning a public figure being vilified for demanding social benefits for people crafts a vision of corporatized dystopia. You feel it everywhere, and it's really affecting.\n\nDon't get me wrong; as fun as it is to play through, as a technical game, its issues do occasionally detract from the experience. That does not change the fact that as a total narrative experience, few games even come close to its accomplishments.\n\nIf you go in expecting a fun action RPG with great story and lore elements instead of GTA: Dystopian Edition, you might see the genius of Cyberpunk past all its technical flaws.",

As long as you don't mind not being able to 100% all of it, it's a very decent game, worth it at the 50% off I got it.

The graphic is absolutely satisfying even without highest settings.\n- Another \"Yes\" for gameplay. Despite some bug and glitch, I still enjoy the gameplay, few bugs not make it unplayable but can be annoying for someone.\n- After I have see other reviews talk about how rush is the game's main story, I see the point. I wish they add more details on main story at last, it would be much appreciated.\n- The most disappointed thing for this game is character building choices. Not only they aren't free customizable, there are also few choices we can choose (some are trash).\n- Another missing content: Car customization, Properly Police bounty system, More new area to roam (still too few district right now)\n\nSummary: Good game but have to put more work on it, more details. After that, it can be one of the best game, sadly not now.",

        "content": "Just finished in 2022, and worth the time imo. Yes as an RPG it has some room to live up to the best titles in terms of choices and consequences -  the ripples of the player as the game progresses, with multiple distinctly different outcomes. That said the actions you take do have smaller ripples and the game isn't quite as good as displaying them when you play the first time, but which you can see in later play throughs.. The endings do have some very different routes and outcomes but it is not a mass of bespoke endings. Still the endings I felt were very powerful, more on that in a bit (no spoilers obv). In terms of play styles, weapons, skills and perks, it has great depth. The world is also quite big and there is a good amount of stuff to do as bigger side quests, local quests and random ones etc.\n\nWhere I think this game gets some serious points over many many others is the story and the endings genuinely do make you feel a wide range of emotions. The choices and consequences on the story are one major part of top tier RPGs, the other is the how the actions you take make you feel. For people who loved the emotional ride and ending of games like KOTOR, Witcher, Mass Effect, Dragon Age etc, this game can absolutely deliver that. It's got some pretty hard hitting messaging about life throughout the game (if we're being honest) and with the endings in particular.\n\nAdmittedly, I can see them being more poignant for people who have lived a little themselves, I'm sure the average teenager will not take it in. It can be a bit trite to say a game is art, even among gamers, but this game really is imo, it has messaging, layers, deeper meanings and parables everywhere, like any literary classic. \n\nThat said, no spoilers, but I genuinely felt this is a top tier game for hitting you right in the feels, and making you think. Right up there with my memories of finishing some of the greatest RPGs of all time. Definitely worth a look imo if you need a solid RPG.",

I'm sure like my many personal problems, complaints, struggles, and alike that their are many that agree and others who have their own basket of issues and complaints. The graphics and overall look are amazing and definitely help contribute to push to simply own this game in order to bask in the possible absolute ownage that your PC could demonstrate as 2077 proves to be a true benchmark tester within the new year of games.

It still deserves its chance to be GOTY. I want to tell you about this game and why it shouldn't get as short shrift as it did on initial release:\n\n1. You're buying on PC. You need a good PC (my rig can't even load it but I play on GeforceNow just fine) but you will experience FAR FAR FAR FAR FAR fewer issues than the folks who bought it on last-gen consoles.\n\n2. It's not perfect. Don't expect it to be. It's an open-world game much like Skyrim and I have some 400+ hours playing Skyrim and despite the bugs I loved both Cyberpunk and Skyrim. Just don't expect it to be perfect: I have to reload my game sometimes to make Johnny's Pistol able to shoot while aiming, and at launch I saw way too many folks in a T-pose in the bars. The most hilarious was calling a motorcycle. It would drive up to your position then upend itself because the recall/delivery physics seemed to not be in connection with one another. At least on PC, they've fixed it mostly. It is what it is. Skyrim got game of the year awards from nearly every publisher.\n\n3. THEY FIXED IT. Kind of, but mostly good. As I mentioned in (2) the bugs you see in YouTube videos are mostly in last gen console releases. I would say 90% of the panning the game (deservedly) got on release was from people playing on old hardware. No, CDPR should not have even released the game in that current state, put you shouldn't worry because you're here on Steam.\n\n4. ACCEPT THE BUGS. It's pretty well fixed on PC now, but there are bugs. Just remember how much we all love Skyrim despite it.\n\n5. YOURE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET TOO MANY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FUTURE. Yeah...the saddest thing for me is not getting any official expansion DLC or anything. It seems like the response to bug repairing on old hardware is taking up most of the team's time rather than developing new content. I wish they'd scrapped it on older consoles and just given us GTA2077 but what're ya gonna do?\n\n6. DID YOU LIKE BATTLE ANGEL ALITA/GUNNM? Play this game.\n\n7. IN THE END IT'S GOOD. Bugs? Yes. Bad launch? Yes. Not quite as fleshed out as it should be? Yes. Best Game of 2021 (It came out December 2020, technically, if you want to complain). Mostly yes, unless you're a hardcore strategy fan when you should be playing CK3 but they delayed released all year too. Worth $60? Hard to say definitively. For most folks, no. I'd say $40 on sale would give you a good time worth your money. I know this review is on Steam so we're all PC gamers here but *absolutely do not recommend to your friends on last-gen consoles to buy this*.",

        "content": "*Edit and spoilers ahead, for the few dimwits it might bother*\n\n-Prologue Footnotes-\n1) I stand by my first review of the game, expressing how it was disappointing half baked rich kid's GTA experience posing as an RPG with no real choice with too much filler content and so many bugs to boot mostly caused by the \"revolutionary graphics\" and the engine's physics, also pointing out how GTA SA/Saints Row 2 did some of this game's concepts alot better.\n2) I wish steam had a 1 to 5 or 10 rating system, because this game falls flat in the chasm that is a \"lukewarm\" experience, alot of potential, but all around boring and pointless.\n3)  I did not want to buy this game originally, nor did I care to finish it, almost felt compelled to refund it after the first act, but I felt like I needed to press on, this was to be an experience, a study of sorts, so I kept on going accepting the inevitable and it's consequences.\n4) I am a general media consumer (books, movies, series, cartoons, comics, music) that demands quality and/or personality.\n\nSome might argue, with my total played hours (170, more or less) that I've had my money's worth. However, as mentioned before, this was, in a way, a sort of quest to achieve Nirvana. What is Nirvana? It is when you realize that no matter how many times you re-incarnate in the hopes of achieving a better more illuminating life, it is pointless, therefor, willingly cutting yourself off the cycle of birth death and rebirth. Twisted sense of humor aside.\n\n-The Pros-\n1) The game looks amazing during a storm of any kind or during the night or during sunrise in the desert or on the beach.\n2) The combat system is responsive.\n3) The inevitable demise in one shape or another of the main character is interesting.\n4) Graphics are amazing.\n5) Driving the \"akira\" motorcycle in first person is the way to drive in this game, quite a rush.\n6) Game has a lot of vertical, especially when you buy one of the leg upgrades.\n\n-The Cons (brace yourself, the list is long)-\n1) The graphics took too much priority on the project at the expense of everything, especially game stability.\n2) The difficulty system is your typical damage sponge system instead of realistic damage and improved AI.\n3) Various game breaking bugs during quest prompts or cut-scenes.\n4) The characters were not fully developed and felt like hollow shells in service of the script.\n5) The execution of the story felt rushed, unpolished and uninteresting.\n6) Too many filler quests, not enough story driven quests\n7) No car dealers or garages. Seriously, wouldn't have been a bad Idea. The idea of this \"available used cars\" per \"fulfilled contract\" is weird.\n8) Cannot try outfits before buying them, also, overall, outfits lack variety and are ugly.\n9) There are narrative arks, 4 to be precise with some minor details, with 2 extra directions per arks. Yes, what you do or don't do will reflect in an end cut-scene, but overall, this game's choices and possibilities and scenario play-out are flat, predictable, uninteresting and honestly, not real choices.\n10) Voiced protagonist : some people might think the opposite, voice protagonist means more engaging... Wrong, it means : it is more expensive budget wise to keep the same actor highers to do more lines, it means less possibilities in story deviation, it means a harder time for a player to project themselves as the character.\n11) incomplete arbitrary broken skills and attributes.\n12) Unnecessary and poorly developed romances.\n13) Driving in general (akira motorcycle in 1st person perspective aside) is unpleasant and clunky.\n\nThe reason for my opinion isn't the game itself at face value, I've seen all of this and then some in previous titles yet enjoyed myself. My problem with this one is : the price and the lies (look up the history of it's PR campaign). In all good conscience, I cannot recommend this game unless on sale for 15.00 USD. What I mean to say isn't that it is a bad game, instead it is merely that I see the potential, but must live with the disappointment : 5/10 OR 2/5.",

I wasn't anything special, But it didn't really need to be. No developer needs to try and re-invent the wheel. \nThe side quest were also fine. Fun even. I did genuinely enjoy the game at times. \n My experience with glitches was very tame. One broke a side quest, A few were audio/screen filter glitches, And (much to my amusement) my disembodied (and suddenly bald) head would pop out of the roof of my car at random times (also my pants disappeared once). \nNone of the glitches I experienced came close to the chaos that I've seen in other peoples videos and reviews. \n\nThe reason I cannot recommend this game is because of the thing that I mostly wanted to experience... The main story. \n\nThey can fix all the glitches they want, Edit and refine the gameplay to their heart content, But nothing will fix that lack luster main quest. \nSpoiling Jackie's death in the trailers was a smooth-brained move, All the effort was put into the first few hours, And your starting path ultimately bears no weight save for a few dialog options. \nAlso, Johnny Silverhand is an unlikable and annoying dickhead IMO. \nForced friendships (or any kind of relationship) in games suck. \nMy V shouldn't be acting like his \"choomba\" if I'm actively making choices that piss him off. \nIf anyone is my choomba, It's Takemura.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 is just on the cusp of incredible potential. The game once again showcases CDPR's knack for brilliant storytelling. This is one of those games where not only is the main story super immersive, but even some of the side questlines get you equally sucked in. There's a lot to talk about, so I'll try to break it into a few columns.\n\nSTORY: \nYou are V, a mercenary for hire in Night City. When you [spoiler] botch a job with your friend that activates the construct of Johnny Silverhand in your conscience, [/spoiler] you are pressed for time as you hunt to find a solution that may save your life. As you dive deeper into Night City, your struggle transforms from something personal, into something much larger against a world that is dominated by corporate infrastructure. The main story is quite captivating overall, and while it definitely falls a little short in Act I with some of the introduction content, it ramps up quickly as you move into II and III. There are a huge number of side quests and gigs to complete around the city, a lot of the side quests prove to be captivating and a nice break from the torment of V's struggle in the main story. A lot of the gigs and POI's feel like busywork at times, but they are nice pickups if you need eddies or upgrades.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nHonestly, despite controversy, Night City is beautiful. Admittedly, you need a pretty tough PC to run the game comfortably. I am on an RX 6600, with a mix of medium/high and ray-traced lighting enabled, and it's been a perfect combo to keep at or above 60FPS. I believe the game has some sort of minor memory leak, as FPS dips a little lower after playing for an hour or two, but restarting the game fixes this. Optimization is not perfect, but there are a pretty wide array of options to help run on a decent variety of hardware configurations. \n\nGAMEPLAY:\nIt's about what you would expect considering the nature of the game. The first person perspective is a nice change as opposed to what Witcher 3 was like. Gunplay feels satisfying, but definitely could be better. Unless you scavenge a lot and get super involved with crafting, you'll find yourself using variants of the same few weapons throughout most of the game. Skill trees are really wide and diverse, and can even feel a little overwhelming in the beginning, but you begin to hone in on what skills you like as you take on more quests and understand the mechanics a bit more. The hacking is a neat little feature, but it takes a minute to figure out cyberdecks and such things. It's definitely a little more involved than say Watch_Dogs was, for example. Vehicles are... just okay. Driving feels fine, it gets the job done. \n\nUnfortunately, there are still a preeeetty big variety of bugs & glitches in-game. Between Steam and GOG I have put in a few hundred hours on this game, and have not had anything game-breaking, but there are small things that become an annoyance (i.e. objects glitching into cutscenes, visual noise, issues with vehicle spawns, etc) but you learn to overlook some of them. This is an area that could use improvement, though. \n\nOverall, Cyberpunk 2077 is a deeply immersive experience that is soured in some ways by the limitations of the bugs and glitches it continues to face. The story is rich, and will suck you in pretty quickly, and will keep you coming back for more. If you are patient with the story and the gameplay, you will begin to fall in love with the potential that CDPR has enveloped this game with, and though it may have faced a rough release, you can see the vast amount of care that was put into what exists in the game. Hopefully it will continue on its roadmap to improvement so more and more people can enjoy something that was clearly worked very hard on.",

So many more stories to tell in Night City!!\n\nCDPR - I have absolutely adored this game. Sure there's a quirk here and there - nothing that distracted from the experience at all -  but I've never played such a deep and moving game. Such a rich experience. It was like living a movie, so immersive, so engrossing. \nStunning.\n\n\n--Update---\n62 hours in and still absolutely loving it! Still not finished the main story - just enjoying the city doing missions as I go!\nTotally fallen in love with the characters, can't wait for more stories and adventures!\nDon't think I've ever played a game with such tangible characters.\nHighly recommended!!!\n\n----\nUtterly stunning game!\nI'm 30 hours in, just enjoying the world and the atmosphere!\nMaybe the criticisms were warranted 12 months ago, but the game I'm playing in 2022 is one of the best games I've ever played. Up there with Half-Life, Zelda...It's in my top 5 of all time. Sure there's better shooters, driving games etc, but the atmosphere, characters and incredible story is just captivating - I'm having such a good time!! Don't think this one will get uninstalled till there's no more DLC left to play!",

Only minor cosmetic bugs here and there, most of which actually made me chuckle, like my vehicle being nearly totalled during a cutscene haha. The combat is extremely fun and can be approached from tons of different ways, and the story is good enough by itself that i wouldn't mind playing it without any combat. Aesthetically, even on my humble RTX 2060 this game looks amazing. I can't wait to play it on my 2080Ti with RTX turned on. Tons of fun, very underrated, and CD Projekt Red has done wonders fixing this game since it's admittedly horrendous launch. Super great game, I highly recommend, and I will likely be playing at least one or two more playthroughs before i've had my fill, maybe more since the modding community has been doing a lot recently.",

        "content": "WARNING: SPOILERS\n\nTLDR: don't spend a lot of money on it and don't expect it to be fully finsihed, devoplment was deffintly rushed but i'd recommend it if you want a time killer with amazing(but buggy) graphics and a even better main story. Do be warned it will crash a lot on lower end computer though.\n\nTwo and a half playthroughs in and I still love it, BUT and a big BUT, there are some issues. And since GTA 5 is the only other game I can really compare it to I will be using that comprison a decent amount. And keep in mind I purchesed Cybperpunk while it was on sale so I'm looking at it just for it's marriets.\nP.S I have dyslexia so some spelling and grammar issues will be present. \n\nTHE GOOD;\nI'm going to talk about the good first as there is a little bit more to go in depth than the bad. \n\nFor one as a LGBTQIA+ member it feels so much more inclusive and welcoming than say GTA 5. There is something for pretty much everyone and the community is so much better. \n\nThe game play really can be what ever you want, my first playthrough I blasted through and killed everything and was done in less than 20 hours. My second I took way more time, I looked through night city, I figured out how to actually be stealthy, I romanced Judy, I talk with Silverhand alot more, and I could go on. The playthrough I'm on right now is to visit things I never payed attention to and get the secret ending, and so far I've decided to pump my strength stat and barely used my guns. \n\nI love the fact that while what you wear does affect stats you can all so wear what you want and upgrade it. Along with the fact that clothing has alot more meaning and even if you cant join the gangs in night city you can dress like and get along with them.\n\nAnd on the note of gangs they all feel so much more alive, the chatter between gang members feels like they are not just bullet sponges. And all of the gangs have unquie styles and motives. It's very diffacult to mistake one gang for another. Even with scavs and malstrum looking similar far away you can tell them apart easy up close.\n\nEven on easy and normal the action is lovely and bosses still pose a threat espcailly if you havn't fought them before. The cut scenes do feel a bit odd at times and Judy's BD tutorial segment should be skipable, but other than that they are generally great.\n\nThe main story has made me shed a few tears once and tear up alot, the relationships with npcs are great and quests you expect to be short boring quests can turn out to be a whole lot more indepth than you thought. And things I thought they wouldn't go through with showing like the quest line with River Ward end up being insane and it feels like you are in a horror game.\n\nTHE BAD:\nI'll mostly be talking about surface issues that as of time of review could be fixed/improved apoun.\n\nCyberware could deffintly be better, and i'm talking mostly in the phyical changes area. It was a MASSIVE let down that I could not chrome myself or get protechtics, I do understand that these are large diffaculty to put in and not super important but I hope that you can at least do this in the multiplayer. \n\nAs many other reviewers say, the back ground paths don't really matter. They make some diffrance but the street kid path changes virtually nothing and the corpo path has the best opening and best diologe choices (in my opinion, but than again this entire review is my opinion) and the nomad has a great bond with Jackie (when I get to panamas quest line I will update you) but other than that it really dosn't change much.\n\nAnd the cops don't do much in the game.\n\nAND THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, the bugs and visuals. For one you can't turn down the quality any lower than low and even low looks amazing but breaks my computer. But I have seen the fallowing bugs:\n\n-Panam hold her rocket luncher after fireing at the AV\n-everytime i'm in a car with a NPC they're skin flickers in and out of exsitance\n-Panam T-poses while in the tank sometimes\n-Corposes stand up and do idle animations like they are alive\n-T posing enemys when the walk up and down things them\n-Adam Smasher standing still during a portion of the fight\n-Falling through the map (only happened once but still)\n-If I change through menus to fact it crashes my game\n-Shadows T-posing\n-Infitent falling after hitting a curb while running untill i jump or stop \n\n\n\n",

        "content": "This is a hard review to write, I genuinely wanted to like this game.  Great plot, great graphics (when they work) and a good time.  Why not recommend it?  It's still pretty buggy, and you can see the great game underneath, but it's still not there.\n\nThe positive side of the game.  The plot is A-One, fantastic, like good cyberpunk harkening back to William Gibson's Neuromancer from 84, the game asks some pretty heavy weight questions behind the glitz.  A permanently wired society is part of that equation, and no more starkly does the comment Gibson made in a documentary seem more relevant here \"Technology is man's way of pretending to be social meanwhile perpetuating his loneliness\", something to that effect (It's spray painted in the movie \"No Maps for These Territories\" on an underpass).  You are extremely connected but very very lonely.\n\nGraphics, when they work, are stellar.  Game physics, when they work, are stellar.  Graduated skill tree is great.  Going to the ripperdocs (something my kids take to calling all doctors now) is interesting.  Hacking seems quite natural in the middle of combat.  The cars are pretty awesome as well, you can see Bugatti Veyron's/Audi concept vehicles pointing through the custom game models.\n\nThe bad.  This game is buggy cheese.  I couldn't finish it, one quest that requires a specific sequence of saving then loading at an early point in the game basically killed the game for me.  I leveled up thinking I could go back and finish.  I did, game borked, one quest that prevents the sequence for finishing, a quest that won't activate until that quest is done and the final confrontation is all dead.  So I roam Night City a feared vigilante buying all the cars.\n\nDrive to fast, game can't keep up (I'm on an average machine that being said, it's a ASUS ROG 4 years old) and you dive into the nether world.  Run too fast, game can't keep up.  Wrong angle, can't pick up the dropped item.\n\nQuests are pretty hum ho.  Interesting where stealth is a greatly rewarded option is good, moving the game from mid range to much much harder.  The overall quest variety is pretty run, kill, steal for the most part.  It would be nice to have quests where you don't have to pray and spray to finish.  Build something, start a festival, have better talk me out of the situation options.  \n\nMY BIGGEST ISSUE:  I don't know why game developers, and CD Projekt Red isn't the only, choose to have an entire illicit and graphic option to the game.  Seriously public nudity, hookers, strippers, sex scenes adds nothing to game.  Where Duke Nuke'em from back in the day had strippers it was a novelty, maybe occasionally fan boys liked to see some boobs.  But a system of hookers that I can solicit and then use.  It's depressing to think this is a feature in the game that adds nothing to the game overall and detracts from playing with certain people.  The nude model choices as you clothe various armor and guns is dumb.  \n\nMaybe I'm just old and jaded but it's out of hand and doesn't do anything in a sex saturated society anyway.  Plus I'm sure the time the developer took to making a sex option would have been better spent , say releasing a finished game.  \n\nOr take it the other way, make the sex solicitation a part of the game system where you can buy and sell your body for money.  At least then people can learn the depressing and harrowing adventures of sex workers and the dangers of sex trafficking instead of glorifying the act of being a John.  At least I can have homosexual encounters including heterosexual encounters I guess is a step in the right direction.\n\nFinal Verdict: Don't buy this game, wait until it's patched at least version 1.6 or higher.  It's still far to goofy to play in the state its' in.\n\nEdit: 1.5 is pretty decent.  Still the cars are goofy when driven however overall certainly improved the overall game play.  I'd still wait a patch or two, but if you want to long haul and see the changes, getting this now is alright.  The endings are quite bitter sweet.",

Many times I've been left wandering if things that happened were supposed to happen, or if they were bugs. Guns have bugs, perks have bugs, armor bugs, npc bugs, vehicle bugs... \nMaybe in a year from now, it will be really good and enjoyable. Right now? Go on, play it, but be aware of what you'll find.\n\nEdit: Patch 1.6 added a lot of weapons and stuff, yay! Nope, game now crashes constantly. I'll have ta keep waiting",

        "content": "Don't believe what YouTube and the news told you last year. \n\nThis game is a 9.5 out of 10. \n\nThe world is the best written I have ever seen for a video game. I'm talking better than the likes of Final Fantasy X and Horizon: Zero Dawn. The voice acting is incredible. Your character's story is nothing short of one of the best character narratives ever seen in a game. You ever do a deep-diver on a famous comic book character? Like Wolverine? Deadpool? Or Spiderman? Like really gone deep into their lore and seen their most spectacular moments? That is what V's Story feels like. \n\nNothing feels watered down, nerfed, or censored either. This game doesn't feel like it's trying to be safe, sanitized, cater to a particular narrative, or be politically correct and that is SUCH a breath of fresh air in this day and age. (Side-note, this game was green-lit and started production almost a decade ago... We may never see anything like this again.)\n\nThe setting amazing as well. Night City is one of the most spectacularly executed worlds I have ever seen in a game. And that's not a surprise, the creator of the Cyberpunk franchise Mike Pondsmith has been writing this material and this universe for 30 years and it definitely shows. And the fact that he signed off on most everything in this game... Is a really beautiful thing. \n\nKeanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand is literally breathtaking. He's deranged and unhinged but the more you see the universe he lives in and the more you learn about him, the more you understand why... He's just not psyco for psyco's sake, he actually has reason for it. He does do some terrible and inexcusable things but... Damn if it he isn't at least well written and interesting. \n\nNow, the only major flaws- \n\nThe bugs- Yes, they exist, but in it's current state, it's no less buggy than most open world games. I had one side-quest bug so I couldn't complete it on my second playthrough. I had the occasional random item I couldn't pick up, but it was never anything important.  And I had one or two wonky cutscenes where characters would T-Pose over two playthroughs. That was it. That was literally it. \n\nNow... The real flaws... Combat- \n\nKEEP YOUR DIFFICULTY ON EASY. Why? Because the moment you turn it up LITERALLY EVERYTHING turns into a bullet sponge. And it's not just early game when you have crap guns either, it's literally the entire playthrough that'll be like that. You see that \"Moderate\" danger job on your police scanner? Yeah, every single enemy takes 15 bullets to go down. And the \"High\" danger ones... You'll run out of ammo fast doing these even on normal. And the really annoying part is that it TAKES FOREVER. I got to the point where I could do moderate danger jobs no problem but I just got tired of literally everything being a 10-15 minute firefight. It was annoying, so I turned it down. I'd definitely call that a balance issue... \n\nAnd I have more knit picks... The guns weren't quite futuristic enough for my taste. Okay, I know we're not THAT far into the future but some more lazers and Star Wars-esque blasters would have been appriciated. Again though, this is more of a knit-pick than a real issue. The guns that we got are really damn cool and the futuristic ones that are there are rreeeeaaallllyyy good. Yes I was mildly disappointed, but what was there was just fine. \n\nAlso, I din't much care for the melee combat either. I ran Monowire and while it was supposed to be the \"highest damage\" melee implant... It felt lackluster. Especially since I had actual baseball bats that were more powerful, and Katanas as well. I felt like since implants are such a big deal, that they should be HELLA OP, and not feel like a regular pocket knife. \n\nBut again, these are knit picks. \n\nThis game is AMAZING. It's the best game I've played in years and judging by the circumstances surrounding it's creation, we're not gonna see anything like it again for a long time... \n\nPlay it. Just play it. The media lied. It's amazing. Play it. \n\nThanks for reading!",

It would be almost understandable and forgivable, if it weren't for the fact that a year later, nothing done post release has improved things.  Specifically I mean, Janky physics, poor animations, no graphical optimizations whatsoever, side storylines that just stop (I'm looking at you Mayor), lack of meaningful choices (in a game where your choices \"matter\"), and forcibly linear missions (which limit usable builds on higher difficulties).  I'm sorry to say this game has been a mismanaged mess on par with EA's Anthem.\n\nCDPR should take this as a lesson, substantially downsize your marketing team and focus on making good games.  You should have had more developers than corporate cheerleaders involved.  It's clear the PR engine oversold this game and it's equally transparent they misrepresented the game willingly.",

And I don't generally follow the hype leading up to a release either. (Many YouTubers seem to enjoy nothing more than ruining shit for subs and views these days.)\n\nWhat all of this means is that I had very few expectations, picked up the game for 50% on Steam in December, and went into it with patch 1.3 from the get-go, on a 5 year old PC (i7 & Nividia GeForce GTX1080).... and I'm enjoying the @#$% hell out of it!\n\nDoes it have bugs, oh yes, there are bugs. A car here and there floating two feet of the ground, which you can get into but can't drive. A invisible car in a junk yard that hopefully one day I'll be able to scan and check under the hood. The odd roll of eddies I can't pick up, and -rarely- a character's hair, clothes and skin textures glitching during conversations. \n\nBut none of this bothers me too much. The musical score is excellent, the characters are likeable... Judy, Panam... I'm looking at you... and the storyline keeps me engaged. The city is beautifully made, and I've run into some truly hilarious conversations between NPC's while exploring on foot.\n\n",

The choices you make during the entire game play doesn't really seem to matter for the most part. You do get different endings at the very last mission, but still it's no RPG.\n\nThe city atmosphere, ambient sounds, combined with the visuals really makes it immersive, at first. It was disappointing to find that most buildings and shops cannot be entered and they really are just there as eye-candy. It would've been amazing to be able to enter tall buildings and go through each floor, but I understand that would complicate a lot of things. It's still pretty interesting to just walk around or drive around the city without interacting with anything.\n\nThe game has been out for a year now but there are still lots and lots of bugs. Most of them are minor bugs that are pretty funny to encounter, but there were several actual bugs that were game breaking and required reload. Was originally going to give it a negative review due to that but the side missions changed my mind.\n\nHere's the list of bugs/annoyances I've encountered during my full game play v.1.31\n\n- gun not firing while ADS (required reload)\n- engaging in combat while driving in certain places, with no enemies around\n- cops on you for every little thing, good luck driving somewhere without hitting a ped.\n- nothing happening after 'waiting a day' for sidequest (time skip)\n- NPC dialogue talking over each other\n- certain NPC dialogue staying on screen if you walk away from them before they finish (reload fixes)\n- audio bugs\n\t- radio not playing in certain vehicle\n\t- NPC dialogue not playing but can see subtitles\n\t- very quiet dialogue then very loud all the sudden and quiet again\n\t- no engine sounds, no door closing sounds, random.\n- V's shadow T-posing\n- objects floating \n- trees glitching out\n- cars running into each other and merging\n- unable to pick up things that I am hovering over, picks up other thing near it instead. (very annoying)\n- terrible GPS guidance whether by walking or driving. keeps changing path and the lines don't follow the \n   road\n- minimap being too small & zoomed in\n- absolute clusterf- of the map.\n- too dark in some places even with RTX off\n- too bright while in first person mode in car rides\n- NPC riding invisible car/bike while the actual car/bike is 10 ft in front of them\n- FOV zooms in after waiting, reload fixes.\n- Summoned car spawning in road above/below you if standing on multi-level road\n- Summoned car not driving (destroying it and re-summon fixes)\n- Summoned cars spawning on top of each other then popping out\n- Weird shadow/graphics glitch that shades everything dark and continues when looking around\n- Lots of minor visual glitches and getting stuck in random places",

(adjust the steering gain in the settings and don't brake and turn at the same time)  Yes, the attributes and perks haven't yet hit the sexy synergy of The Witcher 3's system.\n\nYet.\n\nIf TW3 is any indication, CDPR will continue fine-tuning Cyberpunk for years to come and their efforts will be well worth it.",

        "content": "There's a lot of things that can be said about Cyberpunk 2077, and while I know that the release was a rocky start to say the least, I can happily say that they've patched up a lot of the game, and if you, like me, weren't particularly hyped up for the game before initial release, you'll enjoy the game just fine. Though I should say, the beginning of the game itself definitely feels ambitious compared to the rest and imo you will always pick up traces of these aspirations no matter what happens, and that will detract on some level from the enjoyment of the game, though not nearly to the point where it's unplayable/unenjoyable, it'll just leave you wondering what could have been.\n\nI definitely did enjoy the game, but there are a few critiques I have that bug me, and considering it's easier to talk shit about things than it is talk good things about them, I'd like to get them out of the way. First of all, the story definitely feels, I'll say largely inspired by, Tales from the Borderlands, both are dystopian futureworlds where you play as a corpo/streetkid and have to deal with a charming and famous terrorist being stuck in your mind after a high-tech USB you insert into your cybernetic brain and they try to take over your body, one of your characters fall in love with a pretty and overprotective nomad girl with braids, one of the main characters has one fully metal arm, both are critiques of capitalism, and so on. I had kinda realized this shortly after the game released, long before I had bought and played the game, and while it turned out to be kinda true, saying they're the same story or that Cyberpunk appropriated the story mostly from them would be inaccurate, both stories have very different tones, character arcs, and endings, and you can tell this was meant to be a lot more tragic, artistic, and heavy. But it still ended up distracting me at times, and this is kinda what I meant with aspirations earlier.\n\nI'd assume they were gonna have entirely different stories for each life path previously, would it have different, more inspired stories, because frankly as epic as the game is, sometimes I feel it takes itself too seriously, I've only played as a streetkid so far, but from what I can tell, the existing story would work best for either corpo or partly streetkid, nomad should just have been completely different tonally and be more about family, honor, contrasts to different ways of life, and traditions/abandoning them (this would be serious but not nearly as heavy and depressing tonally as the existing one), imo a lot of the later half of the story really works for the streetkid, as well as the very beginning, just not a lot of the parts in between, well except for the fact that imo the tone is completely off, for a streetkid it should almost be nihilistic, snarky, sharp, and somewhat light-hearted on the surface but perhaps the deepest and most depressing one, the flow of the story again works for them, imo the best ending makes the most sense for that character also, but yeah. I actually think the existing tone works best for corpo, and tbh the story itself too, though that's partially because I think the other two should have one downright happy ending among others, whereas corpo one should be pretty tragic overall. I doubt they can make major changes to the game and the story at this point, even with DLC, I personally kinda hope they pull off like a \"Snyder's Cut\" version of the game basically after a while where they release a version of the game that feels more like how it was advertised, but frankly as long as they keep giving the game support, DLC, content, bug fixes, and etc. I don't even care at this point.\n\nI have a few nitpicks that I wanted to mention that I felt would have made the game better. Firstly, I didn't really like the overall plot and ideas surrounding the biochip and shit worked, and frankly considering as I said with regards to similarities to another game, they really shoulda relegated that main story to one background only and gone in different places, but that probably wasn't the plan for them, and it is what it is, and frankly I enjoyed Johnny's (Keanu Reeves' character) company enough in-game that even I'm eh on this. Kinda wish they also had different voice actors for different life stories, maybe it's too much but I feel as though having like the current guy for corpo, idfk Troy Baker for streetkid, and someone else for nomad, as well as with female counterparts, would have made it a lot more unique and interesting to play, but again might be asking for too much. Something else people kinda have issues with (myself included) that has translated over from the Witcher 3 is that you don't get to spend that much time with a lot of the side characters outside of their character quests, which are fairly short, and while I kinda get it, it doesn't really change the fact that it feels weird to not talk to Panam for so long and then just end up at the end of the game, they didn't really give enough time for some of the relationships to really build, and again what's there is alright, there just could be more of it or done in a way that is more satisfying.\n\nSpeaking of Panam and the end of the game, one of the biggest issues I might have with this game, and this is truly bizarre imo, is the side quest limit, or well, the lack of clarification on the game's part. What I mean is, the story isn't particularly long, and basically by the time I had arrived at the point of no return, ie the endgame, I hadn't been able to do a lot of the sidequests with Panam, Judy, etc. and initially I thought it was bugged or something as just doing more jobs didn't seem to work and the old reputation of the game didn't help, but I realized over time that basically you can take on only a particular number of side quests, and if you don't finish those assigned to you at the limit, you can't get new ones, and frankly I actually wouldn't really care otherwise if they had just FUCKING SAID SO CLEARLY EARLIER lmao. But yeah, it's w/e.\n\nAnyway, now I'll go through some shit that I think is praiseworthy, and while this might seem shorter than my critiques, it's easier to criticize something wrong than it is to praise something right or well-done. On a technical level, outside of the bugs (of which most are gone but there are some here and there), this game is awe-inspiringly beautiful, mostly graphically but also to some extent in parts of the story too. The writing is pretty great and on point, ngl some parts of the story are definitely a bit too abstract even for my tastes but overall it's great, the characters are complex and interesting and dialog is good, though. I like the weaponsplay and to some extent melee combat, and I really wish there was more platforming involved in the game, not necessarily a vital part of it but a bit more of an option than it is now. Something else I really like is that you always do missions and play the game your own way, you're usually given multiple ways of doing something and I really loved the fact that they give you, the player, a lot of freedom with how you want to play, you can go in hard or stealthily, and play to your strengths (or weaknesses if you want to improve a skill) and yeah, I'd say everything outside of melee combat, which imo is a bit awkward at times and needs a little bit of work, is pitch-perfect in terms of gameplay. The missions, the gigs, and so on are fun and interesting to do, and traversing the world doesn't really get old, the game design imo is quite well done and kinda would give Rockstar's pretty much dead game design of having the player drive everywhere or call a taxi a run for it's money. The music is amazing, my main complaint would be where's the punk or the hardcore section cuz for a game named Cyberpunk it doesn't exist, but other than that there's not more of it/types of it, it's great. Overall, great game with flaws, 8/10.",

I feared for my V every second of every mission not knowing what my decisions would bring upon me. \nVoice acting (especially male V) unlike anything I have experienced in video games ever. It was all so believeable.\nThis game hold 1st place along with RDR2 in terms of best graphics for me. Absolutely outstanding and breathtaking.\nAfter I finished Cyberpunk 2077, no game could match it in any category ever since. \nLooking forward to DLCs. \n",

        "content": "It's been nearly two full years since Cyberpunk 2077 launched, and I would say that at this point the game is finally in a healthy state.\n\nAround the one year mark, I made a reveiw on the game voicing my concerns and dismay about the state of the game. I was excited for this game because I was a fan of CDPR. I played through all three Witcher games and loved every one of them. I knew this game had \"trouble\" at launch, so I waited about a year and bought the game on a half-off sale. I knew that the game had a couple of patches released that fixed some issues, but I didn't know just how bad it still was.\n\nI sunk around 50hrs into the game before I decided to right a reveiw. I was upset that one of my favourite developers had hyped us up on false promises, and released an unfinished product, but I still wanted to give the game a chance.\n\nA full year later, at this point in time I would say that *most* of the issues I took with the game have actually been fixed, so I feel the need to update my previous review. Regardless of community backlash, CDPR never gave up on the game, and has worked tirelessly to udpate the game into somthing close to what the original vision was.\n\nAre there still issues with the game? Yes, but not nearly as many as before. Is the game? Absolutely, Cyberpunk 2077 is now one of my favourite games. Would I pay a full $80 CAD for it? Not at launch, but now in it's current state I probably would if I wanted it bad enough. I would encourage people like me who were originally unhappy with the game to give it another shot.",

        "content": "Fantastic game, had little issues with crashing or bugs, the game was very stable and only crashed a few times. This game is very well written and it's extremely creative, the main story is better than the vast majority of movies and tv shows these days. \n\nA lot of the side stories are very cool too, I plan to play again and do most if not every side story before the last main story line mission. the voice acting is incredible, so far I played as the female V and her VA is nothing short of amazing, one of the best I've ever heard, you can tell she put her heart and soul into it, it's sounds so friggin believable. I plan to play as the male V too, but I gotta say make sure you play the female version also, you really don't want to miss out on her quality VA, it truly is amazingly well done. Not taking anything away from the male voice acting just haven't heard it yet.\n\nThere are multiple endings, I got a pretty good open ended I think, I was told have fun with Johnny and do every mission you can with him and his old pals, and the ending will be better for you, well, mine was a decent ending I think, though I have no idea how it will play out in the DLC. \n\nIn any case this game is harsh and the ending can leave you thinking wtf, did I win, did I win glory, what will happen now? It's a bit harsh the same way game of thrones is harsh, when it comes to death, I don't want to spoil anything, but I think this game is more about the journey and the adventure, and it is quite epic, rather than the ending. With that being said, I do hope the DLC goes in the direction I think it will.\n\nThe ending is definitely a huge teaser, the kind that may tick you off a bit because you're not sure exactly what just happened, but I hope in the DLC they give us total closure, one way or another, you'll see what I mean when you finally beat it, and you'll probably  be thinking what I am, god, I want to know now, stop with this anticipation already! Regardless, this game is amazing, if you like open world games, an intense story line, engaging characters with great voice acting, if you like sci-fi, get this game, you'll love it.\n\n",

The only bugs I saw was audio not playing, cops still being a joke, and dialogue not syncing up with the characters mouth. But putting the rare bugs aside, this game is crazy fun. It can grab you and sink you into the world of Night City. All the detail that was put into making this city feel alive was perfect from the start of launch. All of the ads that are plastered across Night City have so much personality even if some are a bit erotic. The guns feel nice but by the time you hit level 30 everyone who comes in your path with do nothing to you and the damage you do to the targets with vaporize them. Driving is also very nice. Story is perfect, the only complaints you see are nit picks really. 8/10, could be better but once they fix combat and fix all of the audio bugs I will give this game a 10/10",

There aren't that many games out there that make you FEEL something about the game characters.\n\nI've re-played the game, what, like, 2-3 times now, as different characters? And still - there are quite a few moments in the game that still make me choke up.\n\nThere have been a lot of negative comments about the game - and most of them are well deserved!\n\nBUT!\n\nLets just stop griping about the technical aspects and marvel at it as a work of art! The music, the sound (yes, it supports Dolby Atmos, and if you have the equipment - you absolutely MUST turn it on!!!), the visual style, the voice acting, the characters, the story ark - all top notch! Technical department comes short, of course, but then again - look at HalfLife! People loved it for the story!\n\nOf course I would love it so much more if it was, you know, actually FINISHED! But technical aspect is not all that makes a game a GOOD game.\n\nI really, truly hope that CDPR hires competent developers (I hear they're hiring modders - good choice!) and finally makes it a game we've all been expecting for so long!",

While Cyberpunk has a fair few issues that can be noticed, it still packs an enjoyable world filled with a decent story and great characters. And riding through the illuminating night city into the desert wasteland is without a doubt a true experience. \n\nIt can not be overstated that the world in Cyberpunk is atmospheric and rich with personality. I would though argue that the intro (1st act) to the game is pretty bad in intriguing the player and plainly is not that fun. Do not assume that the intro reflects the whole game however since the main part of the story is a great experience. That experience is especially enhanced by the characters who are greatly written, humorous and interesting.\n\nThe most glaring problems will be a few glitches, t-poses and crashing that may happen. While for me I never experienced any crashing, even on ultra settings, there were a few instances of t-posing and characters glitching into each other. Other than that I didn't notice any major problem with the game in my 20+ hours and the majority of the bugs were located in the beginning and disappeared midway through the game.\n\nIn the end Cyberpunk is a mixed package but delivered when it matters most: in gameplay, story, graphics and characters. It is a flawed gem for those who love open world dystopian rpgs. \n\n",

This game is phenomenal and has so much potential for the game and future installments. \n\nIn the beginning I never had experienced any issues with bugs glitches or anything and at this point they are dedicating all resources to this game and dropping support for previous gen, (which was probably more than 2/3 of the negative buzz around it.) \n\nThe story is great, the characters are great, the graphics are incredible and so is the art style. \n\nWith the release of redmod and a massive dlc in 2023 and continuous updates based on community feed back there is no reason you should not get this game. \n\nMixes funny, dark, sad and gruesome story elements with characters and world space. From the cyber psycho encounters and back stories about corpo shady ways they deal with NC citizens to the side characters you randomly end up loving. There\u2019s tons to do in this game. \n\nNot to mention the brain dances and shards that really are interesting and I hate reading in games, terminals in FO series for example. \n\nThis game does a great job at creating the world and makes me hopeful for the future. \n\nIf I had to describe it with 3 others games it would be dystopian future Witcher, gta and fallout pulled into one. \n\nOverall I would give it a 9.5:/10 and highly reccomend buying this game but CHECKING THE MINIMUM AND RECCOMENDED HARDWARE. If you have a system that can run it. \n\nCan\u2019t wait for more from this game and I just started playing it again.",

Throughout your time playing you see little glimpses of what the game was supposed to be, an amazing in-depth RPG with one of the most beautiful and detailed worlds to date. But what you get instead is a barren wasteland of content, laden with bugs and glitches, many of which have been in the game since Day 1; all crammed into a game now marketed as just an \"Action-Adventure\".\n\nAn example of one of the many bugs you'll encounter. if you press any button whatsoever while answering the phone with Delamain (and I believe this can happen with other people too), his face will freeze in the top left and you will never be able to use your phone again. The ONLY fix that worked is to reload a previous save, and if you haven't saved for a couple of hours, you're SOL. In addition to this you can't interact with almost any part of the world, dialogue choices have little effect, AI t-pose constantly, Police are essentially non-existent since they've been reworked, driving is horrible, character customization is worse than decades old games when it was marketed as revolutionary and complex, locked to first person only, etc, etc. As a whole the game just feels empty and \"dead\", unlike competitors such as RDR2 where it feels like you're a part of a living breathing world. And really I cannot understate how many bugs are still in the game, it genuinely feels like what most games would consider to be a Beta version, instead of a year + since release.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the devs are NOT making it better. The roadmap for improvement is continuosly pushed back (I think it has been revised 3 or 4 times now, each time simply moving the deadlines back), and each patch brings little to no changes whatsoever. The best that I can say about this game is the scripted cutscenes/missions are usually quite good, and visually it is stunning. I would not recommend that anybody buy this game now or in the future, it has not received the No Man's Sky treatment since release and I doubt it ever will. What a disappointment coming from the company that made The Witcher 3.",

The gameplay is intense and fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat, the music gets you pumped, and you can't help but to fall in love with characters. The storyline is a bit short, but where it lacks in length, it makes up for in amazing character development. There is plenty to do in Night City, but after a while, it's just the same thing in a different location. I would get this game ONLY if it is on sale (how I got it).",

        "content": "Overall:\nIt's a very beautiful game with very interesting and somewhat touching storylines, with a lot of gray areas and interesting pointers, although the game fails in many aspects, and can be quite challenging to play (I'm not talking about difficulty). If you're looking for an interesting experience in a world that sometimes feels a little to real, join us, and enjoy. However, if you're looking for a well-optimized and enjoyable GAMEPLAY experience, you might want to choose something else. All in all a beautiful but irritating game.\n- Rating: 6.5/10\n- Recommended Purchase Price: $25,- and below\n\nPros:\n- The game world is absolutely beautiful and well put together.\n- Capture mechanics allow you to capture the beautiful world.\n- The characters are well fleshed out and often feel like real people making real decisions.\n- The story is very interesting, even if it feels a little short.\n- Mechanics allow you to take both a combat-focused and stealth-focused route to many missions.\n\nCons:\n- You cannot change your appearance, once you're done making your character without mods (except aparrel)\n- Glitches and bugs often occur, ranging from simple ragdoll and movement, to teleports and sudden un-aggrevated combat and performance spikes\n- Movement system and keybinds make the game frustrating at times (tapping the key once makes you move slightly; tapping it twice dodges you out in front of an enemy you're hiding from)\n- Combat is an overcomplicated numbers game, forcing you to get better gear rather than becoming better at the game\n- Enemies don't scale with you (at least not according to what I've seen). Instead they have set attributes and then the game \"guides\" you around the city, matching your level to the enemies (missions have an indicator telling you how challenging they are for someone at your level)",

Runs like butter. \n\nMy old computer... 1080 GTX Ti, i7 8th gen, custom liquid cooled loop, shit ram, HD/SSD combo... was not worth playing the game. \n\nAll in all, the best MATURE PLAYER game you can get. Yes, there is a lot of straight up nudity and shit. \nI am a big RPG fan, the mechanics for that are good also. Story is great so far, you can choose from 3 different \"Lifestyles\" which start you at different areas depending on which you pick. \n\nGame is really good, make sure your system can handle it though before buying.",

        "content": "Game is generally fun and many of the characters have fun dialogue, but it's really more of a looter shooter than the RPG it should have been. \n\nIt feels silly to loot 15 of the same exact shotgun from the corpses of your enemies only to scrap them all to upgrade your own weapon, which also is the same shotgun. The weapon variety is weak and I feel like the game should have focused on cyberware utilities rather than upgrading weapons and armor. Many times, the only difference between two items is the stat numbers associated with them. They could have accomplished this by having one version of every weapon, maybe with one iconic version of each, and then letting skill, nethacks, and special abilities decide the rest of combat. \n\nWeapons aren't the only thing that there are too much of. Consumables litter the world of Cyberpunk. It makes sense that food would be readily available with the vending machines and whatnot, but they added so many different kinds of consumables that all do virtually the same thing. Meanwhile, some restaraunt owners will tell you about a specialty item they serve, only for them to sell the exact same crap the vending machine sells outside with nothing at all that separates them from other restaurants or vending machines.\n\nTrying to play only as a nethacker is lame because higher level enemies will have insane RAM costs to cyberattack, and many enemies even at lower levels aren't connected to a network anyway. I feel like there should have been an implant of some sort that functioned like a PAN or WLAN that would circumvent people not being present on a network. Police, for instance, aren't hackable at all.\n\nBecause Cyberpunk is purely about damage numbers and upgrades, it's basically impossible not to get OP. The only thing that can really kill you are explosive propane tanks and cars, which for some reason deal infinite damage. By the time you reach the \"no turning back\" mission you should be able to crit on at least half of your shots with whatever gun you use primarily, and one shot kill the majority of enemies you face. It's more fun to just hop in a car and ram enemies, but your car will blow up if it gets shot at in combat at all which also happens to be the second possible way for you to die.",

        "content": "UPDATE after Edgerunners came out (which is an amazing anime btw, I'm impressed, and also after we got shows like Rings of Power, Edgerunners is like a breath of fresh air, like the purest air you can find) BUT:\n\nAfter all this time, this game still has incredibly annoying bugs, like \"Roach\" still comes up flaming and hitting other cars or I get stuck by hitting some pole and I can't move my car so have to go away and try to call vehicle again. Not even getting to how stupid the AI continues to be, I expected full force development on this area after the huge backlash this game had at launch, but no, they don't care, traffic is dumb af, same as you'd play a 2000s game. I can compare the AI with an amazing game that came out 20 years ago, Vampire the Masquarade: Bloodlines, it was absolutely amazing back then but 20 years later we still have the same brainless NPCs hunkering down on the street for no legit reason. \nTo give some example: I was trying to park my car on a sidewalk marked with a parking spot and a guy continued to walk into my direction so I stopped the car and tried honking. That did nothing, as the guy continued to walked unaffected until he hit my car and performed an animation as if I hit him instead and everyone in the area started panicking. \nOn the other hand, I was walking down the street when a guy suddenly fell from the building with blood on the pavement and all and NO ONE on the street said anything. Yeah, makes sense.\n\nShame on you CD Projekt for not working on this idiotic AI behavior that completely destroys the hard-earned immersion. Completely lost all hope that this game will ever be as amazing as they first announced it.\nBut if you consider it to be a 2000s game with upgraded graphics, great story, great characters then yes, sure, it can be enjoyed. If you expect a next gen game, you'll be disappointed, sorry!",

        "content": "RIP Jackie Welles. Johnny Silverhand did nothing wrong. \n\n[b]tl;dr[/b]\nFirst, I gotta ask the haters what other futuristic open world game with driving is better? The game pretty much came out as early access but this game is still amazing nonetheless. Don't let haters make hyperbole out of the bugs when the story is top-notch and the gameplay is enjoyable albeit you do need a good PC to enjoy the most out of it. Even 30 frames isn't enough to fully enjoy combat but you can easily beat the game no problem at 30 frames.\n\n[b]Review[/b]\nI beat this game with my old PC with a processor at least 1 generation below minimum requirements for the game and still got about 30 frames with little to no bugs (none game breaking) and still enjoyed the game on very hard difficulty. Then I played it my new PC and enjoying every little detail about this game on my quest to 100% and lore dive everything. Anybody complaining about unplayable bugs at this point needs to fix their own hardware rather than blame the game. Yes, there will be bugs but nothing that breaks the game (unless you're intentionally trying to break the game). Just ask yourself what other futuristic openworld rpg with driving mechanics are there?\n\n-It's Skyrim in the future except with a much-more fleshed out character rather than the blank slate that is \"dragonborn\". Both of these narrative choices have their own pros and cons but for Cyberpunk it was smart to give V some personality with the player nudging V in a certain direction similar to Geralt in the Witcher series.\n-Good gameplay, nothing revolutionary but a very solid experience. Whatever you like will find your style in both fashion and gameplay.\n-Great story like seriously the one of the best of all time. I can't talk highly about how good and interwoven the characters are with the foundation for future content to be made which I hope for and will preorder in good faith.\n-Bad Launch, that's corpotism and overhype for you. I came into the game with realistic expectations in terms of gameplay and graphical quality and I was not disappointed.\n\n\nFirst of this is one of the best stories ever told in the history of video gaming. There is this and one other game (Red Dead Redemption1/2) are both games that could be adapted to high quality cinematic shows. That's how amazing the Cyberpunk story is. All endings are amazing. What I did was make a save right before the point where you decide between all the endings and replayed each ending from that save point. It was one of my favorite gaming experiences in history.\n\nStill worth the AAA price-point. CDPR had to release this for two reasons 1)Stock investors getting greedy and wanting to push out a title for the holiday season and 2)the hype was building too damn much, any longer and people would have had the expectation that this game would solve world hunger and help you graduate college. As seen from launch reactions people already were expecting as much so in my opinion CDPR should have waited but I'm thankful I can at least try out the game earlier than expected and still enjoy it thoroughly.",

I find the game to be the same, it's an amusement park ride just like an Ubisoft game. All the money is to be on the screen for you the player, hence why anything worth seeing is plastered all over the map with markers, there's nothing to discover outside of what someone at CDPR wants you to see. This means there's nothing to discover years later by accident years or so later beyond easter eggs or things individual devs hid from everyone they work with or total accidents. There's no natural discovery since you're always following quest markers or being bombarded with calls to do a job you happen to be near as you make your way though the city. It makes things what ought to be entirely happen stance like the full metal monk or the talking vending machine feel off, because you're led there by the nose if you use the map for your next job.",

        "content": "Did a 100% playthrough (all side quests, gigs, etc). I bought the game at the 50% sale that I've been waiting for because of all the bugs and problems at release.\n\nTHE CONS\nThe game still has some glaring and annoying bugs, some still gamebreaking (Delamain bug). A bunch of items just can't be picked up. Zooming in on traffic in the distance still looks god awful because you see the cars are just horrible looking \"props\". Driving on roads outside of the city just emphasizes this because cars appear in the distance but as you come close to them they disappear right in front of you cause there's barely any traffic outside of the city. My car still sometimes got stuck (mostly in the junkyard). Parked cars levitating in the air. NPCs appearing as if they're driving without their vehicles loading for 2 seconds. Live dialogue and phone dialogue happening at the same time. Items NPCs are using becoming clipped inside them. And so on. All this on a last-gen PC (5900x, RTX3080, 32GB of ram...)\nThe city sometimes feels empty, like nothing's happening. NPCs sometimes act strangely. Raytracing is cool and pretty, especially when roads are wet, but a pretty city can't replace a living city, and sometimes parts of Night City just lack... stuff. People, quests, traffic, anything.\nThe police is... just very bad. They start attacking you for no reason. Driving a car slowly and peacuflly? Yeah, gonna attack you. Trying to save civilians from some thugs and just passing over them with your sniper scope? Get a warning immediately. If you get a star, the police still spawns basically right on top of you. If you run away without killing any police and then come back in 40+ hours of playtime to that same spot again, you better be sure those same cops you spawned ages ago are still going to be there waiting for you and starting combat as soon as you appear nearby.\nThe gear aesthetics system is horrible, but I guess this doesn't need explaining to anyone who's played. Sometimes you really do end up looking like a clown just because you want to equip the best gear available to you at the moment.\nIn short, I'd say even this amount of bugs, problems or missing content is still unacceptable for a AAA game, but that's just IMO.\n\nTHE PROS\nBut hell, the story is actually so fucking good, especially toward the ending. I found the prologue kind of lazily shortened and unimpactful, but the rest of the story actually makes up for it. The amount of endings possible is amazing. Sure, not all your choices in all your quests are important, but man, the choices for the various endings are very impactful. When it ends, you just feel sad it ended and you're just hungry for an expansion-type DLC.\nThe city, despite of its many obvious flaws has so many beautiful areas which just suck you in. Just architecturally speaking, the city is convincing, impressive (both ugly and beautiful) and huge. It lacks more \"life\", not sure how else to put it. But man, the areas that do have life (the center of town, the park around Arasaka tower, the memorial around the tower, the industrial areas, the slums etc) are absolutely stunning. \nThe music is amazing and I think anyone can find a radio station for himself. Storyline music takes the cherry for me though, especially the outro music, after all the important NPC \"phone calls\".\nI'd say the world of CP has so much potential, it's ridiculous. It also makes me realize, even as an ungrateful gamer, how much love and effort has been put into the game. Even more importantly, I do think in many regards this game was too ambitious to be without any problems. Yeah, the CDPR corpos screwed the audience and the devs (as far as I can tell), but even 2 more years of development might not have made this game trully \"finished\". \nI do hope, however, that they do keep working on it and bring out all the potential it has. Fix bugs, add basic content, add some more life to the city and add more DLC storyline quests, this game can be truly amazing. Right now I'd give it a 6/10 and I can't recommend buying it for the full price. I bought it on half price and I'd say it's barely worth it. All of that combined plus the fact CDPR straight out lied about what will be in the game prior to release means I can't give this a \"thumbs up\" on Steam.\n\n",

        "content": "I've been waiting for this game for many years. When i first heard about it i was sucked in immediately. I looked up the old tabletop references, waited for every teaser and trailer, and got the guide on release. I love this universe and the stories it holds.\n\nThat being said, after 100% and 1000+ hours of gameplay, this product falls very short of what was advertised. It's buggy, missing features shown in trailers, and after a year it has failed to get much better. I still have high hopes for what is to come, and truly believe this game can one day be one of the better RPG's of this era.\n\nWhy I recommend:\n-The game world is admittedly shallow, but the writing and lore are deep. From finding notes on side missions, crimes detailing the events prior to the jobs and violence of those deceased or involved, to articles and \"books\" detailing the world and its politics. even the little things on the T.V. in game give you info on more of the world outside of Night City.\n-The music is SO good. The fight music, radio, and the score. Even through all the hate this game has received, in my opinion, they nailed this and there is a reason this game was nominated for music if nothing else.\n-The ability to hack as a whole works very well, and if you take the time to see your surroundings, you'd be surprised what is hackable. You can use these powers to not only harm your enemies, but confuse, immobilize, and even fool into falling into traps. It is a great feature to make you feel like a spell caster similar to other RPG genres.\n-The crafting system is tedious to say the least, but it allows you to maintain weapons and clothing you find to be your favorite to be viable deep into the game. I've seen people wear ridiculous outfits for the stats and mods they can hold. If you craft the necessity to do this goes down tremendously.\n-Finally, the story itself. It is well written, exciting, and dark. The characters are brilliantly portrayed. Although many complain that what you do doesn't much change the outcome of the endings. The way you interact with key characters you meet will change how they view you in the end game credits. I.e. if you were rude, cold, all about business, a friend, and how far down the line of quests you went with them.\n\nWhere you might find disappointment:\n-Driving still has a lot to be desired. You can not shoot out the window of your car. Chase scenes and scenarios are non-existent. (well there are like two but still). Evading the police is as simple as getting in some wheels and driving a few blocks.\n-The police A.I. is trash, even I can not speak any good to it.\n-The game has gang like factions that you basically have no interaction with other than, pew pew, bang bang, zap zap. Here and there you have a side quest or story mission where you interact, giving you a small hit of role-playing with these factions, although they're few and far between.\n-Performance of the game as a whole. (one day that might change.)\n-The U.I. and menus are poor and take some getting used to.\n\nIn all I had a great time playing Cyberpunk. If you allow yourself to be immersed, explore, take time out to do some shopping in the world for gear and equipment, you will find stashes and Easter eggs that will tell of these little stories i spoke of at the beginning of the review. This game is far from perfect, and i wish the developers the best on making this game what marketing promised. Until then, buy this game at a price that seems fair to you. At this point I'd say no more than 30 USD, otherwise there is a possibility wishing you spent that on another game.\n\nTL;DR\nCyberpunk is far from fantastic, but it is not terrible. Do not waste good money on it, wait for it on sale or buy where it is on sale. Features are to come, it will get better.",

Played for over ten hours so far since buying the game a couple of weeks ago and I'm enjoying it. Would recommend to people who have at least a reasonable PC. The game is gorgeous with a good graphics card. Driving cars is a bit clunky with only a keyboard and mouse, but otherwise gameplay is good and the story enjoyable. Will update this review if that changes as I progress through it, but no reason to suspect it won't be fun until the end and then likely replayable with a different character build. Recommended",

Sure, there are some bugs here and there in the game but I love this game. Great Game play, stunning visuals and really reminds me of Blade Runner. I really love Cyberpunkisque Visuals and this game doesn't disappoint. I don't know any of the Cyberpunk Lore and that's why exploring the city is fun. The story line is magnificent. It's worth the money. Breathtaking! Looking forward to more fixes and improvements (Vehicles and NPCs keep vanishing, no lip movement in characters while having a conversation etc to name a few issues , ).\n\nSometimes the city feels empty. AI acts in a very unnatural way. Collisions are a bit weird and the driving experience is boring. I keep hitting cars and the AI does nothing. Really wanted the people to come out of their car and get aggressive. It's still a great game though.",

Yes. Yes it does. \n\nItems spawning just underneath terrain textures so you *can't quite* get them? \u2713\nTerrain textures visually fighting over which gets to grace your screen with their presence? \u2713\nPeople and vehicles suddenly cycling through a kaleidoscope of colours for no reason? \u2713\nGame suddenly freezes and crashes with zero warning? \u2713\n\nHonestly, a game as ambitious as this, which is totally open world and filled with all kinds of little side-show curiosities, deserves a pat on the back. There are entire games that are sold *purely* around the driving mechanics that this game has. The firefights are more interesting, the action elements are better and the \"open world\" is a vastly more interesting place to explore than either GTA V or Fallout 4. \n\nI don't regret buying this game for one second.",

Its based on a paper based TTRPG and not a JRPG - so part of the experience is how you choose to play. Its far closer to games like GTA than it is Final Fantasy, with a vast open world and a great setting. \n\nThe main story lines lead to 5 different endings and yes, the choices you make only change that path so much. But the vast amount of side quests, sudden instances and achievable achievements is what has entertained me so much. Memories of cruisin' down the beach in Vice City listening to 80s classics has now been joined of screamin' down the main highway on my bike listening to Samurai.\n\nIs it glitchy? Yes, but not so that its unplayable - yet to play a game that didn't act odd at some point.\n\nBut what is fun is to play how the character thinks - TTRPGs are all about immersion, and if you immerse yourself in this game you do get rewarded. A streetkid living by codes or an ex-corpo turned renegade out for revenge.. make the \"Open\" part of the world your own narrative and you will have fun.\n\nPlus you get to meet a talking gun.. whats not to like there?",

The Writing and characters are a close second in the quality department. For example, I replayed through half the story as a woman just to bone Judy, and it was totally worth it. And the dialogue between V and Silverhand is a lot of fun. This game is not as bad as people say. Just buy it while on sale or something idk.",

Having played Cyberpunk 2020 (the table top game), for many, many years, I was excited to see how well they portrayed Night City.  Oh, my god!  They frickin' nailed it.  The city is vibrant and really amazing, it's very immersive.  It's not perfect, the general NPCs are a bit too touchy, especially if your car happens to run up on the sidewalk (even if you don't hit them, they all run in a panic).  And, your car IS going to run up on that sidewalk because the driving is pure shit.  I highly recommend a motorcycle (you can get two or three for free), they are much easier to control -- or... get a car with a short wheel base, as they are better at hugging the road.  Every other car feels like you're driving a tractor trailer rig on ice.\n\nThat said, the actual gameplay itself is a lot of fun, and you have multiple approaches, knock em out if you want the no kill achievement; gun them down with some really impressive legendary weapons, many given to you as quest rewards (or just sitting out in the world waiting for you to come find it; or kill them with one of the many melee or blade weapons (which is another thing the devs did right, cutting someone's limbs and head off with a katana looks and feels amazing (especially if you get the Cyberware that slows time in combat.\n\nThere are still glitches, and a lot of items you cannot pick up because it's fallen partially into the floor because of a clipping issue... but those are becoming fewer and fewer as the devs plow onward towards fixing the mess they made at release.  However, the title is definitely worth the current 50% off for the Winter sale.  I promise that, once you get the hang of it, you won't be able to put it down.  I haven't... and there are tons of games that I think look great, play for two hours, and then put away never to touch again because they're hot garbage.  Unless you're a pedant who simply cannot shut up about things like frame-rate drop (which I've experienced none of with my GTX 970 and 144 hz monitor) or the few glitches left to be repaired, Cyberpunk 2077 is nowhere near hot garbage. It's actually a lot of fun and I can't recommend it enough.",

ANYTHING! Don't buy this trash, I've tried adjusting every setting, the brightness doesn't work and altering the shadow settings didn't do anything!\n\nI've got a i7 6700k, an RX 580 4gb and 32 gigs of ram. This meets the minimum requirements. None of my other games give me any troubles and my graphics drivers are up to date. This sucks.\n\nUpdated to Positive review post 1.5 patch and AMD Driver update 22.3.2:\n\nIt works now, all my prior issues have been addressed. \n\nThe gameplay is solid, its basically an open world version of Deus Ex Mankind Divided with more augs to play with although you can only use one at a time with the rest being passive perks. \n\nYou will be gate kept out from using said augs unless you can find a ripperdoc selling that specific aug and have the pre-requisite stats to suit your playstyle. I don't mind needing the right stats my issue is the RNG nature of the ripperdocs inventory. I would have preferred if some ripperdocs had certain augs fixed rather than fast travelling around the map praying to RNG jesus to get the one I want.\n\nThe story is good, you fight evil corporations alongside Keanu Reeves aka Johnny Silverhand. The main campaign is short but the value is in the side quests, Keanu appears more in those and the loot from them is worth it.\n\nThe RPG elements are weak for roleplaying, it makes little difference if you start as a Corpo, Street Kid, or Nomad aside from an alternate starting intro. There is still some texture pop in issues but its fine the in game cars are cool to drive if not a little floaty.\n\nAll in All its worth it I'd say.",

Yes, it was pretty broken at launch and yes, CDPR did make a lot of promises they didn't keep. Everyone else has talked about that though, and I don't want to. I'd rather talk about enjoyment per dollar. \n\nSo will you get your money's worth for $30 on this game? I think so. It's got a decent little storyline, though there are some plotholes. Some characters you'll like and some you'll hate. It's got a ton of sidequests that can keep you entertained. The combat isn't next-gen or anything but the gunplay feels tighter than other gun-based RPGs like Fallout or Outer Worlds. It's a really good looking game and there are moments when Night City feels truly alive. You're gonna have some bugs, but you knew that before you read this review. I didn't have anything that totally ruined my fun. \n\nIs it worth $60? Maybe not right now, but pick it up when it's on sale. It didn't live up to the Christ-like expectations that people laid upon it, but It's not total garbage either like some would have you believe.",

Now in december 2021 the game feels quite solid to be honest. I loved the Deus Ex series and this was a great follow up, but at this point more content would be nice. Even as a DLC.

        "content": "I waited a year to buy this game. After the fiasco of the game's launch, I said I'd finally cave when it was either 50% off or reached \"very positive\" reviews on the Steam store. I'm glad I waited, but I'm even gladder I bought it. It's certainly rough around the edges but it's not really much worse than any other open world game with a scope this ambitious, and it's one of the best games I've played in quite some time. \n\nThe game's flaws are mostly minor and cosmetic in nature like odd shadows, flickering lights, weirdness with the interface, and occasionally awkward NPC movement. On the flip side, it actually runs very smoothly with \nshockingly quick load times and not a single crash in 80 hours. \n\nThe side content can get repetitive if you're going to spend hours hammering every marker on the map one by one, so I'd suggest just experiencing it as it crosses your path rather than trying to tick off every possible box before progressing the main story like I did. You'll end up overleveled and overpowered pretty quickly, even on the hardest difficulty. That being said, it's worth experiencing for the story alone, which is excellent. Extremely well-written and acted with the notable but charming exception of Keanu Reeves' performance as Johnny Silverhand; the guy's just not a good actor, but you can't help but love him anyway. It also has far more depth than I've seen some people give it credit for; it has many divergent paths and endings and while it might not offer as much freedom as a true CRPG it's easily on the same level as genre classics like Mass Effect.\n\nThis is a classic example of a game that lost control of its own hype train and suffered too much as a result, and it should stand as a cautionary tale of how not to market a game. It was never going to live up to the impossible expectations it had built up, but it's still one of the best RPGs of this generation. The fact that I just finished the game and am already eager to start again is a testament to its quality. Just be prepared to appreciate it for what it is, rather than expecting it to be something it's not.",

I never saw the trailers for the game, I came into this game not knowing what to expect, not knowing how the game play was supposed to be.  With that in mind I have a blast in the game and am about to go through my 2nd play through.\n\nRUN! Run everywhere!  I recommend running when you have the chance as driving in the game is probably the worst mechanic it has.  It will drop your FPS no matter what and will cause your AI to go crazy.  Whe you enter the vehicle it is either drive straight or go full send on your turn, at least that is the way it happens on mouse and board. The NPC's that drive around act like GTA's NPC's so becareful in the streets.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED\n\nTo me the combat seems pretty balanced except for fist fighting, especially the \"Beat on the Brat\" missions.  Fist fighting and the Physical \"skill tree\" will definitely get you the results you want for physical fighting.  However -, you will only have a set amount of points to spend for your build.  As you progress you will find your own technique and get the build that works for you down.  With that said there are so many different options to choose from for your toon build which can make the RPG element of the game much more intense as you can be stealthy and kill from a distance with guns or with electronics basically.  or close, or mid range, or all of the above.  The possibilities are endless.\n\nMy 1st play through I went with a hacking build, it can definitely be OP but because of the mechanics of the game there is a lack of skills in other areas.  Those skill are not necessarily required to beat all the main and side missions but, based on your build you may or may not have a tough time.   \n\nYou may find yourself attached to a character or two.  It will get rough. Good luck.",

I had just upgraded my PC, ready for the hype-train to swoop me away.\n\nI've probably played about half the game, loads of sidequests, upgrades, missions and so on.\n\nThe combat feels like the later AC games with either bulletsponges or cannonfodder, and no real sense of immersion. For example, the mantis claws looked so cool, but then you spam the mouse button while slowly grinding down an enemy's HP bar while flailing what might as well be butterknives at them, and it's just so lame. The combat is less immersive than AC.\n\nThe sidemissions are often grindy and samey. Fetch and carry, go and kill, etc.\n\nThe street-life is stupid, full of the worst kind of bots. Police spawning behind you instantly, and disappearing as soon as you drive 2 blocks.\n\nI didn't feel invested in most of the characters and when I might be near to immersion for a minute, the bugs would sort that out fast.\n\nSo yeah, I didn't finish the game (same as the last 3 AC games) and I don't really feel compelled to give it another go. It's just not fun.",

I had fun using it as a benchmarking tool as well and was surprised at what I actually got it to run on, though not always very playable on low end hardware. Still, got it to run at 30 FPS @ 720p on an AMD APU. The game itself though; The story is good but not amazing. The characters are also good but not amazing, though Keanus character and the female Vs voice actress are standout performances. Gunplay & combat is \"meh\" at best but I had fun with quick hacks and the absurdly OP overwatch sniper rifle. Driving is weird and glitchy but I also enjoy it once you get a feel for the cartoonish physics. Its amazing to look at - if you just got a shiny new GPU or a new monitor and want a game to wow you, this will do the trick. Slightly disappointed that the game play isn't as good as the graphics but I'd still recommend it. 10/10 looks, 6.5/10 substance, 8/10 overall.",

Now I am fairly confident that most people that play the game in it's current state would enjoy it regardless of if they followed the, let's be honest, pretty shit release. After coming out with a few patches the game runs great for me now when on launch it ran like a quadriplegic trying to do a 500 meter dash. Anyway, the main story is really cool and the side content is even more engaging in my opinion. The only few bad points of the game i can think of right now are a lack of variety in the weapons, (i.e. just different rarities of the same handfuls of guns besides the unique ones you can stumble across) and the fact that side gig missions are the same rinse and repeat run into a building, kill like 15 dudes, run out type of deal. The last negative is that there are still quite a few bugs in the game like people clipping through objects and cars randomly exploding. \n\noverall like 7/10 for me. If CDPR fixes the rest of the bugs and few optimization issues and maybe throws in some more free DLC this could be a really good game overall i think.",

And despite a few weird visual bugs, I really had a great time with it. Played it for about 6 hours the first day and had to force myself to go to sleep. I played more of the game throughout the weeks and kept having a great time. I seem to have been lucky in that I haven't gotten many of the bugs that players have seen. As of Patch 1.3, this game is way less buggier than before. It runs like a dream so long as you don't crank everything to Ultra, and the gunplay feels really smooth and precise, with a lot of variety in the weapons themselves. Love all the cybernetics you can get, although I do wish there were more to choose from, and not just rarer versions of the same augments. The story seems to be hit or miss with some people, but I found the main story to be engaging and enticing, with me constantly wondering where it would go next. And every single sidequest in this game is amazing. Literally the best content in the game is the side content, all of it is fun and unique. Oh, and one item I don't think anyone disagrees on is the music. Every song in this game is incredible, and with some good headphones you really get into it. Finally, the game is graphically stunning.With the right setup, Night City is so cool to just drive around and look at. I know I brushed over a lot of topics in this review, and realty there are plenty of super in depth reviews on YouTube if you want the detailed breakdown of the game. But I would recommend going into it completely blind, as it makes the resulting experience that much better. I highly recommend Cyberpunk 2077, you will definitely get your money's worth.",

By itself, well worth the price. Looking forward to the expansion.",

Then your entire play through will be plagued with \"Oh I guess that's just not in here.\" We were promised the world and got a functional, but buggy sandbox. The character creator was supposed to be something like CodeVein but we got Skyrim. Stuff like the laser wire not functioning like it showed in previews. Items like the laser katana or Max Tac uniform being in game but having no way to actually get them, unless you mod them in. The story being cut down so Keanu had a way bigger part in it. No amount of patches and bug fixes will change what it was supposed to be.",

        "content": "I was super excited for this in 2020, but following the intensely negative reaction to its release, I decided to hold off on diving in. Now, almost a full year later, I finally felt good enough about the state of the game to make the purchase (the 50% sale helped too).\n\nI have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. Not the most mind-blowing open world experience you will ever have, but it never stopped being fun, especially near the end where you are so overpowered that the NPC's just become your little play things, even on the hardest difficulty.\n\nThere are still plenty of bugs in there, but none of the game breaking or progress stopping catastrophes that people were experiencing months ago. You'll often find yourself unable to pick up items around the world, as they have partially sunken through the geometry, but this never happened to me with a quest critical item, ever. I also got into a car once, only to sink through it and into hell, but the game popped me back out into the street after a second or two. Subtitles from ambient dialogue, and audio/visuals from uploading hacks will frequently become permanently stuck on screen, but will always go away after a quicksave/quickload combo, something that only took a handful of seconds on my SSD.\n\nVery fun game with compelling characters and an interesting story, especially if you play out all the Nomad quests with Panam Palmer. Just don't expect any kind of game play challenge. Treat it more as a fun exercise in how to creatively lay waste to hundreds of enemies with your expansive tool set.",

        "content": "Storyline - 9.5/10\nOpen world concept - 9/10\nReplayability - 7/10\nOriginal Soundtrack - 9.5/10\n\nIt wasn't until my second play-through that I genuinely loved playing this game (and played it fully once more after learning there were several endings). I felt my first run-through was extremely rushed, didn't care about character development, and was reckless in my dialogue choices (it could be because I chose the corpo lifepath and wanted to be a d*ckhead intentionally). But with my second playthrough, I genuinely loved playing as Nomad V (Streetkid is also fun) because I felt more relatable to my character. Once I got the hang of the game mechanics, weaponry, and battles, the game was much more playable and fun. I was also very deliberate in my dialogue choices the 2nd time around and it genuinely felt like I was playing Cyberpunk for the first time because of how many different alternate reactions and dialogues there were with all of the characters. It was like familiar territory that I took for granted the first time and played it with fresh eyes and a pair of skilled hands the second time). \n\nI also did more side quests this time around; there are some missions in the game that are heart wrenching and are absolutely MUST-plays aside from the main storyline (I googled 15 Best Side Quests You Didn't Know About).  The original soundtrack was absolutely amazing and wished there were more throughout. I enjoyed many of the \"Radio\" songs but there are some songs the game could do without.\n\nOverall, if you bought the game and didn't play it because it was crucified during its release, please give it another chance. Many of the bugs have been patched and the game is very playable, I experienced no game-breaking bugs whatsoever but a few minor glitches like every huge game has. If you were bored the first few hours, give it another chance as it is slow in the beginning but picks up a lot of speed once you master how the game works and are intentional about dialogue. If you like RPG, hella immersive world, gut-wrenching and mesmerizing missions, and a enjoy a realistic, future dystopian world (that could potentially look like ours if we keep up the horrible practices that we employ towards our planet), this is 100% the game for you!",

        "content": "I've owned this game since launch, and have never encountered a game breaking bug. \n\nThat's not to say they don't exist; I'm fairly certain every game has them.  There's a fair share of obnoxious bugs; mostly involving being unable to pick up loot items.  Never around a quest item, or anything unique.\n\nI've also heard people say that this isn't really an RPG, that no matter what you say it doesn't really change the plot.  While this is true, it's also true of almost EVERY game labeled an RPG.  Dialogue rarely has major effects on plot.  I would say that with the various choices you can make in the quests that this is more of an RPG than most can claim.  Is it perfect?  Hell no.\n\nNext to the open world and feelings of emptiness.  The world is HUGE, and there are TONS of hidden items, events, and even quests.  Can you walk up and talk to random pedestrians?  Not really.  Do they have interactions in the world to give them life?  Some.  That being said, it's the same feeling in GTAV or any other.  It's all scripted, and if you look for it, it's easy to spot the holes.\n\nVisually and aurally, the game is fantastic.  It runs great, looks absolutely amazing (especially the NPCs), and sounds great.  The music and voice acting are superb.  I couldn't disagree more that you don't feel like you should care about any of them.\n\nThe story is fun, and by that I mean it's engaging, twisting, backstabbing, and lovingly relatable.  I'll leave it at that.\n\nAs you can see, I've spent over 660 hours on this game so far, and not once have I ever regretted buying it.  This is also my first, and possibly only review.  Honestly, I don't put much stock in them, but I did feel that this game deserves defending, even if no one listens.",

Gameplay, sounds, gunplay are good, side missions are reasonable, story missions is 50% 50%, or it is boring or pretty cool. NCPD still spawns somewhere but they sayed that theyll fix that, i hope so. There could be better customization, theres a lack of tattos, body modifications visualy etc. Hope that someday they add that. The dolls that work in that industrie have a 1min scene with you that is not what they sayed before the realease, there is only 4 people that you can enter a relationship and thats what they didnt say too, overall this game misses too much content, visually and not visually. Hope that they fix this or that they make a new game with this all things. bugs now are rare at least in pc. The endings were in my opinion all good, the secret ending was kinda trash, it was a copy of one normal ending... now if we talk about choosing the endings, in my first play it didnt make sense that there are other endings that end better... could be there other endings in my opinion",

But quests and gun play and combat and NPC A.I. all crap. The stealth is a total joke. Your A.I. partner in  quests stands there and yells the whole time while you are sneaking around. This game is trash. Even after a year of patches. Wish I had not bought it. If I gave The Witcher III 9 out of 10 stars? This game gets 4 on a good day. Man what happened to CD Project Red?????",

        "content": "Like many others, I hesitated to buy this game based on the numerous issues it faced at launch. I finally gave it a chance during the Black Friday Steam Sale, and wow, am I glad I did.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is probably the best game I've played in 2021.\n\n[h1] PROS [/h1]\n\n[b]STORY[/b]: If you're patient through the many, many hours of dialogue, the story and character depth make for an incredibly rich experience. The \"side\" jobs allow you to add layers to several important characters, and I enjoyed these as much as the main story. The main story features several key decisions throughout that shape the player's outcome.\n\n[b]SOUNDTRACK[/b]: I loved the original score played throughout the main story and will definitely listen to it outside of game. The radio stations were good, but each station only having 10-20 songs will lead to the in-game radio feeling repetitive without jumping around.\n\n[b]GUNPLAY[/b]: There are a lot of weapons in the game, though there were only a handful that I really enjoyed - primarily a few pistols, assault rifles, and the sniper rifle you earn through the main story. I'll likely play around with other builds during future play.\n\n[h1] CONS [/h1]\n\n[b]REPLAYABILITY[/b]: While there are a handful of very consequential decisions V makes throughout the core story, they mostly impact the options available for the player beyond the point of no return in the game's ending. Most side jobs are shorter and more linear, and gigs and crime reports are mostly \"go to this place\" -> \"steal this thing\" OR \"kill a few people\". Once you've tackled these once, there's little incentive to want to repeat.\n\n[b]DIFFICULTY[/b]: If you regularly play FPS games, Cyberpunk 2077 will feel like a walk in the park. Once you level and upgrade beyond a certain point, you'll melt basically everything in the game. I didn't mind this given my interest in the story, but the lack of challenge will likely deter people from wanting to do additional runs.\n\n[b]BUGS[/b]: There are still some bugs present throughout the game, though none were game-breaking and were generally resolved by reloading. The majority of issues I encountered were related to vehicle movement and boundaries, though there were also a few rendering glitches.",

        "content": "When I originally played Cyberpunk a few months ago I wasn't the biggest fan. I thought the story was bland, average gameplay, and the overall jank the game has dragged it down for me. However, I did enjoy the world, characters, and RPG elements. And after coming back to Cyberpunk, I have changed my mind about this game. The story is great, the gameplay is incredibly fun, and yes, the game is still janky as hell. It can be a bit jarring at first but after a few hours in the game and with the help of a few mods, you'll soon get used to it and it will barely affect your experience later down the line. The world is phenomenal, I love the art style, world building, and activities in the world. However I do think the world lacks interactivity. Cyberpunk, unlike The Witcher 3 is missing a minigame. And as a huge fan of minigames in RPG's, this was a huge bummer as it doesn't only give the player more to do in the world, it can also help build the world and give it more personaility. Now i'm not saying the world doesn't have any personality. Far from it in fact. But it would help to introduce a form of board game like cards, dice, etc. But apart from that I think the world is almost flawless, I love everything about it. From the unique terms like \"choom\" or \"gonk\". To the layout of the city. It is so much fun to explore. All the activites in the world are a lot of fun to do and part of the reason they are so fun, is because of the gameplay. The gameplay I originally wasn't a fan of but I have changed my mind about it heavily. The guns feel really satisfying to use and considering this is CDPR's first fps game I think they absolutely nailed it. The quickhacking also adds a lot to the gameplay loop by encourging stealth and strategy into the combat. The skill tree is huge and also encourages different playstyles, I personally played more tacitcally and tried picking off enemies from a distance, but I also tried using the double jump upgrade with a shotgun and playing it like it was Doom. Both playstyles were viable and in general I think this game is pretty well balanced. There aren't many playstyles that stand out as too overpowered or too weak and the build variety is really strong. But now for the story, I personally love it. My biggest problem with the story are the choices, and how the mostly don't matter. The lifepath you pick is pretty much pointless apart from the first hour of the game, and a few unique dialogues. And while there are a ton of endings for the game, they are only decided in the last 2-3 hours of the game which I found really dissapointing. However the endings themselves are all really satisfying and wrap the game up nicely. But apart form the choices I think the story is actually really good. I love the premise and although at times the plot can be pretty confusing. If you stick with it long enough I think you'll really enjoy it. The voice acting and animations are also top notch. Probably even the best animated faces I've seen in a game. It's not as good as motion capture but it sure comes close. And the voice actors are killing it in their roles. V, Johnny, Judy, Panam, Evelyn, Jackie, and Takemura especially. The voice acting and animations really make the characters come alive and the great writing helps a lot too. But most people are worried about the bugs, and to be honest they aren't that bad. I think the biggest issue isn't really with the glitches but more the over janky-ness of the game. It's very rough around the edges and can be a little off putting at least at first. And while a lot of people complain about the driving I actually don't think it's that bad. There are also mods that improve it if it's really bothering you but after a few hours I got used to the driving and found it to actually be pretty decent. However my biggest problem with the driving are the cars themselves. More specifically the way you buy them. I HATE the system in place for buying cars. The way it works is, you get occasional messages from people that tell you they are selling a car, you don't get to pick which car it is, or even which colour it is. You just get messages showing you a car for sale and you can purchase only the cars you get in those messages. Why is there no dealership I can go to? It would not only be more immersive but way more convinient. As in game I can never choose which car I want and instead have to wait hours hoping I get a message for a car I like. It is frustrating to say the least. Also the cars have no customization at all. I can't change the colour or tune the car in the slightest. Another huge issue with the game is the AI. The AI is god awful and is one of the worst I've seen in a game period. They are incredibly inconsistant and will react to things they shouldn't react to, and not react to things they should react to. Its terrible and can ruin the immersion at times. And overall this game lacks a ton of systems that should be in place but aren't and it can be pretty off putting at first. One last thing I wanted to mention was the soundtrack. I fucking love the soundtrack for this game. CDPR don't miss when it comes to their OST's and this is no exception. It really gives the game even more life and personaility. Wrapping up, despite the games problems, if you stick with it, give it a few hours and you just might fall in love with the world and story this game has to offer.\n\n8.5/10",

        "content": "For me, for whatever reason, since launch I had not encountered bugs. I was actually expecting to encounter a few at the very least, then again I probably didn't progress enough to find the most bizarre things Cyberpunk 2077 might have had to offer.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a great game and is worth your time spending in a beautiful world with fairly interesting narration/story-line and gameplay. The execution of the release was poor, I believe there was just a huge problem with the hype, both in terms of how the potential players dealt with it (by being really demanding and impatient) and the dev company responding and honestly looking like they wanted to profit off the hype before it died down (by rushing a release out instead of a complete and competent game product). Good for business, bad for image. \n\nThey also made several poor decisions on other platform releases (like the PS4 and Xbox One versions for the game which suffered the most in player reception), it would've been best for them to not even try to sell on those platforms. But back to this review which is specific for this game on steam and pc.\n\nThe game has good and interesting mechanics. There are also interesting choices to make for the player. And the game play design is solid. The exploration elements/items/objects are also neat. The world, however, certainly feels very trapped in and small and almost sandbox-y. Initially, I wasn't hoping for the game to be a hack and slash (during the first few teasers), but they made it work really well and that is impressive. They certainly lived up to good RPG elements and really took us down a good cyberpunk age/aesthetic road of how we might imagine the world to be in such a time/era.\nThe crafting system here feels like a lost cause because of how the system has been made, despite being properly functional, there's simply just no real reason to use the system when you're better off looting and shopping for the stuff. Of course certain things you might only get through crafting, but there's still no real point to it (since some items in the same category and tier are equally as good or better when you come across them without crafting) and I think the devs could have used that time to spend it on other areas of the game and improve it overall. The Spiffing Brit has a good youtube video showing off an exploit to show how redundant the crafting system is and can easily be exploited for monetary (credits) benefits.\n\nUltimately, here are the scores and TL;DR.\n\nGreat game for PC, as of the current patch there are no major game breaking bugs and very few minor bugs that I know of. Personally have not encountered bugs since launch (except for a few minor ones). It is a good investment, it will give you a fun time if you're somewhat into RPGs and Open World games, don't get into it though if you can't stand the Cyberpunk world/concept. It certainly proves its worth as a Triple-A title.\n\nGameplay 8/10. Story 8/10. Graphics/Visual Appeal 10/10. Combat 7/10. Soundtrack 8/10. Game Performance 7/10. Game Logic 5/10. DLCs 5/10.

        "content": "I really, really wanted to love this game.\n\nUnfortunately, I just can't.  I have tried 4 times to get into it and can't bring myself to.  I got the game on release, and actually didn't have too many bugs.  That first playthrough was my longest but only ended up being 6 hours or so.  I just... Lost interest.  Every playthrough since that one (started over again for each of the \"game changing fixes\") had been less.\n\nBasically, I think this game tries too hard and dabbles into too many things at once.  Night City itself is a fascinating concept, but the game world feel empty.  All the NPCs that roam around are completely useless, making their unique and \"futuristic\" character designs seem silly to me.  The city is very large, so to immersively get around you need to either run around and parkour, which can be fun but takes a while, or drive... And the driving is TERRIBLE.  Also, you are constantly bogged down with notifications.  The mechanic of using the \"phone\" to call or message other relevant characters is realistic, but the number of notifications is just too much.  Seems like every 5 minutes I'm getting a text about a new job or a call from some character I met once and don't remember.\nThe story seems interesting but it didn't overcome the rest of the downsides.\n\nHonestly the combat is pretty entertaining, hacking your enemy's cybernetics then running in with a power shotgun or katana just feels cool to me.\n\nIf you're going to focus on combat, this is a fun game.  If you're trying to just enjoy an immersive cyberpunk world that feels alive, then I don't think this is the game for you.",

Upgrading is interesting. Sound and music are top notch. Graphics excellent with RTX.\n\nThere are things that bothers me regarding the visuals. Rain looks weird as drops doesn't hit the wet streets, drops just disappear. I think RTX was implemented best in Watchdogs Legion, city looks very realistic. Other imperfections doesn't matter, perhaps CDPR will hear their fans out and improve those details.",

It has its flaws and bugs but its still fun and in my opinion the story was great with characters that filled Night City and made it feel full of life. The game was fun and that's what matters to me but I will talk about its bad the relationship section of the game felt empty and like a 6th grader wrote it there was just no depth to it but during the missions with those character they felt full and well made just after those missions there was nothing left to them you only got four options of dialogue and never seem to get more. For my play-through I romanced Judy  and i was hoping that there would be things to do with her like go to the bar or get some food but there was noting and the ending that happens with Judy was shit they could have given you the option to go with her or something other then her just leaving or have V open up to her and have her stay. Now the relationship that you can have with Johnny is good but no matter what they never trust each other even if you listen to Johnny and do things he likes they still never trust each other. Now the end, it was kinda shit I like it but I hate how open they leave it with V just going into space to rob the casino and it was dumb that it just ended there and didn't let things go further but i still enjoyed the game I just wish that what they do next is done this time.",

        "content": "i would rate this game 8/10 solid because they have fixed a lot of bugs but the world still feels emtpy and the gigs and side missions are strongly monkey or busy work i feel like they should have included more to the story instead of just making us hunt down boring cyberpsychos, it does look amazing but some of the things like bugs and other missions that makes me lose immersion of the game and it feels like a hate/ love relationship with this game, by now i haven't finished the whole game and ill come back when i do to edit this post.",

After 200 hours I've seen only 2 bugs (and not critical).\nOn my opinian, for such big game it is awesom result.\n\nIf you have anought time and desire to dive into this world, you will not be disapointed. But! this game will not take your hand and show everything. You should serch and if you do so, there can be found many resalt of your own deeds.\nVery good game.\n\nOnly one real problem - money, it is hard and take too long to earn, and thonly thing it worth spending is cars, which are useless ... unless you want achevement.",

If you're expecting a truly next gen RPG and won't settle for a decent Action-RPG experience then this game probably isn't for you. It's not totally polished there's a few bugs now and then but they aren't super prominent and there are areas you can tell the developers cut corners. However the story and gameplay is amazing and definitely will pull you in and keep you engaged. And one last thing Choombas, Don't let all the bad press discourage you from playing this game personally I think most of it was overblown it's no where near as bad as people say and you should definitely try it yourself.",

Yes, it could be so so much more and hopefully in 12 months it will be everything Project Red promised us. But in the meantime, you'll definitely get your money's worth I feel.",

I really enjoyed the 80h hours of gameplay to finish the game. \nWorth to mention that i did not encounter any major issue. \nThe relation with Silverhand is absolutely amazing, i really love the dialogues. It is deep. It is very immersive and I like the freedom always offered to the gamer to approach situations.\n\nI was looking to start a new game with the PS5 upgraded version.\nBut I could not wait any longer to get a new experience in Night City. So I bought it for black friday to test PC gameplay and potential mods. I really enjoy it so far, try new path in the story... \n\nThank you for making microtransaction free quality games with deep stories,  immersive workd and free gameplay.",

Compare this to the vast majority of games where interactions have your viewed locked in starting at the other talker's face.  \nAlso the fictional city of Night City is awesome.

        "content": "This is genuinely a great game. The writing, storytelling, and visuals are top-notch, and there is plenty of variety and content for gameplay. There are most definitely still bugs, and some elements of the game which seem irrelevant, but considering the sheer scale and level of detail, I'm not surprised that they couldn't flawlessly execute everything they set out to. I'm just appreciative of what's here.\n\nI only was just, unexpectedly, able to get hardware powerful enough to play this beast of a game and so I wasn't waiting for it to come out for years, like others were. I think so many players were disappointed with this game because of the buggy release a year ago, and some unmet expectations. I can totally see how avid gamers would project their wildest dreams onto this game and be disappointed that it was made by lowly humans in the past decade.\n\nAnyway, well worth the asking price, even if not on sale. I'm almost 40 hours in and I don't think I'm halfway through the main content yet, and there's hella more supplemental stuff I've barely gotten into. The visuals are stupendous, especially for some places at some times of day with certain lighting--it almost feels real. So worth experiencing. The whole experience is as immersive as I think a non-vr game can be.",

        "content": "The game will never be finished/fixed, no reason for CDPR to do that once they patch it just enough that people will buy it and they make a profit. Probably the only reason I won't recommend this game; however, if you can acquire it otherwise, it really is enjoyable with a few dozen community mods. Combat, driving, even the audio mixing are all terrible in vanilla, though I feel the story deserves to shine through the muck. It was a well-made, immersive production with fantastic actors and animators that truly carried the whole game.\n\nAs for how the game looks, I can't say much since my computer can only run 40 fps at the lowest settings. Night City was gorgeous and I found myself nostalgic to my first visit in downtown LA, but unfortunately its terribly underpopulated for its size. A mile wide and an inch deep, I didn't find much reason to explore beyond following \"unknown event\" markers on the map.\n\n1.5 update: my point still stands",

There are multiple approaches to basically everything, including options not presented to you directly (which I guess a lot of people missed).

The world itself is good, but technical aspects of it make it worse, like the way weather is calculated will lead to it being sunny 90% of the time. In 14 hours of gameplay I saw rain twice and acid rain once. Mods fix some of the annoying parts, but they can lead to even more bugs.\n\nIf you're going into the game thinking its an RPG - don't. It's an action story game with elements of RPG progression (skill tree). Choices that you make don't really matter and there is often only a single outcome of the storyline and/or quest. Lack of third person view and even barbershop to change your hairstyle halfway through the game makes it very boring from \"dress-up\" perspective. \n\nWait until all DLCs are released, bugs fixed and community does all the work CDPR should have done in a form of mods and only then get the game at 50+% discount.",

If you don't mind reading, much of the lore can still be found within the game. The game play is repetitive but only in the same way as any FPS or any Ubisoft game such as far cry. It can still be fun, even if the tasks boil down to the same actions. A good first start and i hope they get their Mass effect 2 style sequel where they can focus more on characters and the world than simple action. It is a linear mass effect style game with a forced and bolted on 'open world' of ubisoft ilk. I had fun, you might too.",

        "content": "This is not a bad game. It's just incomplete.\n\nThere's an underlying technology here that promises some pretty impressive things. With a good rig, this game looks gorgeous. Neon streets in the rain conjure some marvellously evocative scenes. There's been a lot of talk about technical glitches. I can say that with the hours I've put in I've only seen a handful of problems, none of which couldn't be solved with a quick reload. I suspect that most of the problems come from consoles. It's the same sort of problem VW Beetle owners might have if they tried to compete in F1 races - why can't I compete?! Why can't I do what these funny flat cars are doing?!\n\nThe biggest issue I would have is that the game isn't finished. While there are plenty of fantastic looking cars and cosmetics, there are severe limits. You are restricted with limited weapons, tech mods, mission types, rigid classes and abilities. You have limited ways to customise your character, especially in keeping the the cyberpunk ethos. Want chrome skin? Sorry. Want an arm mod that lets you hack doors? Nope. Want to steal a car to own it? Or put guns and armour on your car? Or have shootouts while driving? Nope. Hacking is also limited to a single type of repetitive minigame that gets old, fast.\n\nThe world also suffers from limited attention. Go through the game missions and stick to those locales in the centre of the city, and everything is fine: there're secrets and surprises and loot hidden in hard-to-get to rooftops. Go off the track a little, and suddenly that all dries up. Cool hiding places that should have something in them, have nothing. There are vast areas where there is nothing. Square kilometres of biofood warehouses with almost nothing around; hidden caves and ledges with nothing in them. It's quite apparent that someone started populating the world, then ran out of time.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes. I think I would. Even as it stands, there's a lot in this game. And as I said, the underlying engine is impressive and can look gorgeous. There is so much potential here. You could almost consider this a tech demo. Or perhaps a foundation you have to buy, then buy more DLC to go on top. But who would ever do something as low-down and dirty as that?",

At this point the game is quite playable, and also quite enjoyable. I'd still call ht my game of the year, even though I had much higher hopes for it in the first place.

Should they have left it in the oven to proof rather than launch it in that sorry state? You bet they should have. \n\nBut under all that mess is the makings of a great game, great character design and writing with good voice acting to boot. The quests and world are vibrant and really drag you in. You get invested in your own character and the world around it. Without the kinks I would even have slapped game of the year on it. To their credit they have worked on improvements already and more are scheduled ahead. \n\nThis is a proper RPG in a market overflowing with a tsunami of bland battle royal shooters from a developer with pedigree in the RPG scene. As it stands with the updates and knowing that the developer is planning on getting this game the development it deserves I fully recommend it to anyone wanting a good story driven game.",

        "content": "Despite it's rough launch, I think cyberpunk is a phenomenal choice. It might not have been the game that all the hype built it up to be, but it's better than most other AAA games being released nowadays. You can tell that no matter where you go, there was someone who but a ton of effort and detail into that part of the world all the way down to the highly detailed garbage on the street. No the game isn't perfect, it was a buggy mess that ran poorly on almost every device. However when the game ran smoothly, I found myself getting sucked into the world and genuinely enjoying the game. I'm only looking forward to future expansions and maybe even an online mode so I can roam the streets with my friends.",

        "content": "Alright, so I didn't play at launch, so I have no comment on that, and I'm running a powerful system, so at max settings I can really see and feel all the little bits of effort that have been put into this game. I have played a completely un-modded game.\n\nSummary.\nI can say without reservation that this game is not deserving of the hate. It's a fun, immersive and engaging roleplaying game. It's not GTA, it's not the Witcher. It's better in many ways and worse in many ways. As it's own game it completely stands up and is one of the better games I have played over some 30 odd years of gaming.\n\nPros: Combat is fun, fast and character development feels meaningful. The story is engaging and interesting, the narrative is incredible if you take the time to read the shards and follow the subplots and scandals of the various factions that control various parts of the city. The graphics, ambience and general immersion are (aside from occaisional visual bugs) great.\n\nCons: The driving is.. bad on anything except a motorcycle, and then it's only passable. Most vehicles you can't actually see what's happening in front of you while going up or down hills due to the extreme low angle and narrow viewports and there's rarely a moment when I'm driving a vehicle that I don't wish I could be higher or lower. The also handle strangely. Some elements (NCPD Scanner Hustles especially) can get pretty repetitive - though I enjoy the little snippets of story you get at the end of each, they do feel a little like busywork. The fist fighting minigame is not great, especially given it's functionally impossible without cyber arms, which the game does not explain at all.\n\nNeutral. The game has a few bugs, most bugs can be resolved by loading a save or toggling a setting, but they are there. Not unexpected given the broad state of modern pc gaming but for some it can be a problem. To be clear, the state of bugs in this game is, I would wager better than the current state of many similar scope games that are much older.",

However, having just picked up the game during the Autumn sale, one year later from release, the game is honestly very playable. It's not without it's glitches or bugs but in my 6 or 7 hours of gameplay already, none were game breaking. I think with more updates to come and hopefully peacemaker DLCs from CDPR, this game can become a game to remember.",

I used to be a big supporter or CD Projekt Red and looked at the company as a shining beacon of light in the money driven, corporate world of games of today, but I've lost my faith forever in any game company from this point forward. Whenever a company gets successful enough, priorities like passion and pleasing the end user get thrown out the window for profit margins. E.g: Riot, Blizzard, Activision, Ubisoft, Bioware, the list goes on and on. \n\nYeah this is just a rant and I know it will change absolutely nothing, but this game was a massive disappointment for me. I had been hyped for years for its release and really did expect a masterpiece rivaling that of Half Life or Far Cry (my favorite single player games), but man, was I naive for thinking so. Thanks for the wake up call CD Projekt Red, my biggest regret is not refunding this game within an hour of playing it. \n\nKeep pre-ordering people, let's keep the endless shit storm of mediocre, broken releases going forever. But, remember, as much as it is the company's fault for releasing an unfinished product, we also need to accept responsibility for continually buying into their BS.",

Gameplay needs much more verticality, because perks are just sometimes are just numbers that doesnt really elevate the combat which is one of the bread and butter of the game. I guess it all comes down to what update they will put in the future. Hope it ends like No Man Sky story. Take this review with a grain of salt. Everyone has different point of views.",

Remove all glitches, all bugs, all errors, make this run on any PC with no requierements...... its still a bad game with bad AI and a world that should be prime in living open corpo-world. Things other devs have done YEARS ago like police chasing you in a god damn police car, you have none of that.\n\nMy final advice?\nBuy the game just as a benchmark of the raw power of your system. \nUse it to see the best visuals yet if you have the GPU for that\nPlay the main story in straight line to enjoy it. Avoid wander the city expecting open world stuff, cause theres none.",

        "content": "One of the best games of the decade (in my opinion, RDR2 and Cyberpunk 2077 are the two best games since 2000). This game scores above the industry average in every important group of parameters:\n1) Gameplay. Combat and stealth are equally satisfying. There is no RPG on the market right now that is even comparable to the CP in terms of gunfights, melee fights, and stealth (e.g. while shooting in The Outer Worlds, which is #2 fresh RPG, is somewhat OK, there are ambiguous ammo types and too many indistinguishable guns). Smart weapons feel amazing, katana and mantis blades have an enormously satisfying feeling. Finally, stealth and hacking are super interesting. The overall gameplay: best in the industry (comparison: Deus Ex, Outer Worlds, Fallout NV).\n2) Plot and world. Authors tell us an interesting story about death and one's acceptance of it. Not really Mass Effect level of drama or Deus Ex 1 level of conspiracy, but the deeply private and personal story. Side quests are, of course, amazing (River Ward's and Johny's especially). I, personally, liked the plot even more than I liked the plot in New Vegas. In addition to that, developers used the universe with developed lore, and the back story of Night City and NUSA is interesting to learn. Finally, every question mark on the map tells a small interesting story or shows a funny place. It feels great to explore the world. Of course, it's not the same city as in GTA 5, but RPGs never were really about super alive open worlds (e.g. New Vegas, Outer Worlds, Skyrim, etc.). The overall plot and world: best in the industry (comparison: Mass Effect, Deus Ex, Outer Worlds, Fallout NV).\n3) Roleplaying. Roleplaying for me is about two things: 1) ability to adjust playstyle (combat-oriented, charming, stealthy, etc.) and 2) ability to express my personal feelings via actions/dialogs. So, 1 - playstyle. I see several possible builds here: assault rifles with dodges, tank with a shotgun, stealth with hacking. Not much, but in Deus Ex HR we had only 1 build that makes sense - stealth (combat is super awkward there), in New Vegas we had sniper, assault rifle, talker, melee plus a lot of room for roleplay with additional skills, such as repair or medicine. Outer Worlds and Assassin's Creed are nothing in comparison. Sub conclusion: good level, not the best (New Vegas), but above the industry average. Now, 2 - dialogs. Yes, that's true, you can only affect the plot so much, but honestly, it's not that kind of RPG that allows you to favor one fraction and destroy the other or that allows you to negotiate in every quest (e.g. New Vegas, Outer Worlds). CP is a more cinematic-like game, and in this sense, the only sensible comparison is Mass Effect, and we can affect the plot way more in CP. But what is more important is dialogues: every time I had an option that represents my personal feelings exactly, and all the other options made total sense (e.g. in Mass Effect you had two ways: adequate character and crazy cruel **** The most important part of the game - V's thoughts about Johny and acceptance of death - offer great dialog options, and I personally felt that I hear answers that resonate with me, the player. Overall: highly above the industry average.\n4) Artistic execution. Music is awesome, all that rocker boy vibe is amazing, the city looks noir AF and rain and light works amazing in pre-designed scenes and just during any night free ride. In that sense, one can compare CP with RDR2, and CP at least slightly worse in terms of light and scenes. Overall: absolutely exceptional artistic work.\nFinal verdict: this game will become legendary and will stay together with RDR 2, New Vegas in the RPG's hall of fame.\nIgnore all negative reviews - people just hate technical execution, but this is temporary, while all that I described is way more important.",

        "content": "Updated Review:\nOkay. Short and sweet, I've returned to Night City. I haven't seen missing thighs within the first 5 minutes (yes that happened), and I haven't watched waitresses walking around with invisible trays (yes that also happened). I HAVE seen invisible interactions (floating cigarette, missing people as part of a conversation, and instruments being played when they don't exist), but they're more rare now.\n\nNow, CP2077 is a game I can play. All games have bugs. Would I like all of them to be fixed in this game, sure. Do I think they will all be fixed eventually? Absolutely not. CDProjectRed is already tasked with moving into other games as a focus, and they're coming out with DLC for this one. If you're writing DLC, you're less focused on bug fixes. But all that being said, I can stay about 70-80% immersed in Night City these days. That's a huge leap for 10-25% in my previous play through.\n\nWhat I would want going forward:\nThe invisible issue, I believe, is due to asset cleanup at some point in the process. The invisible hand pan I saw in my recent play through was easily corrected by walking away 5 feet, and turning back around. The hand pan was visible. So something's going on with the player view asset management. That should be fixed.\n\nDialog can play on top of other dialog without waiting for the proper timing. That's... very jarring. Especially when you have the last lines from the previous dialog with the new lines of the new dialog, and you're trying to parse both at the same time.\n\nSpeaking of dialog, holy shit can you PLEASE change the default dialog skip button to NOT the same button as sneaking? I'm trying to have a conversation with someone, but I forgot to stop sneaking, and now I have to do the entire thing while hunched down like that's something normal people, totally not psychopaths, do.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nAt this point, I'd recommend the game. It's got flaws, but they're easier to overlook at this point. I'd give the game a 7/10. Once I finish it, that may go up to a 8/10 depending on the ending. The last two points can't be made up until the bugs get fixed.\n\nOriginal Review:\nNPC duplication make the \"living city\" aspect a total lie. Not just that but other immersion breaking bugs are still present 1year plus from launch that shouldn't have been there AT launch.\n\nI'll try this again when they issue updates IN 20freakin22! really? Your game is still broken, but yeah, \"we're looking forward\" and pushing all updates. Okay.",

I know it's a first person game but come on devs... if one of your selling points is jaw-dropping state of the art visuals, those realistic shadows are displaying a character model that is suddenly moving like some sort of marionette doll if you do anything other than walk in a straight line.\n\nIf you go into this game expecting a world simulation on par with GTA, you'll be sorely disappointed. If you go into this game expecting Deus Ex with cars, you'll find yourself having a good time.",

        "content": "This game has had its ups and downs from the past year.  Some of the really good highlights are the visual of looking at Night City.  There have been times when playing the game I will move the clock forward for night time and go to the outskirts to see the city lights.  It is really breath taking.  Other times, when I am roaming around Night City, I will try to get on rooftops and take in the scenery.\n\nThe bad rep this game gets is valid such as:\n1. Broken AI\n2. Choices don't matter.  \n     This is especially true when you are building your character and choosing a life path or even when you are \n     building street cred.  You have different gangs, but no incentive to side with one side because of faction \n      rewards like items, weapons, gear or unique missions/quests.\n3. Guns don't feel unique.  \n     If you have played Borderlands, you would know the difference between each manufacturer.\n4. Combat feels repetitive.\n      I went to a netrunner and I would clean out a room without having to step foot inside.\n      I tried another build for melee, and at a certain point everyone became a fist sponge.\n\nThe main story feels heavily borrowed from Johnny Mnemonic.  However, the story is true to a cyberpunk genre, which is: \"A cautionary tale, not a goal.\"\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game if you are really into the genre of Cyberpunk, there are really interesting Easter Eggs in the game that nod to other titles of cyberpunk genre, like Ghost in The Shell, Blade Runner, etc.  I only hope that the developers CDPR will continue to support the game to correct the wrongs committed with over promising and under delivering.   At this time of writing CDPR announced they are done with updating the game.  I can only hope more patches will and DLC content will be coming out soon, but only time will tell.\n\n",

I don't pay too much attention to a lot of those things, I just take it as it is since that is the world that the game developers made. But when you think about it, some of the missing pieces really do feel missing. Overall, if you can't handle the bugs and glitches, don't play the game. If you're fine seeing them, then the game won't be a total waste of time. And as for the performance issue, the game takes some decent hardware to run decently. If you don't have that, then yeah, you're going to have a hard time running it. It's not an optimization issue, its just how the game was built. Stay coping.",

A must-have for fans of cyberpunk science fiction novels, e.g. by authors like William Gibson and Neal Stephenson. Also highly recommended for anyone who loves the Blade Runner aesthetic. In fact, two of the most enjoyable parts of the game are collecting and reading flavor text and just *looking around* and soaking in the atmosphere. In addition, combat and gunplay are visceral and there are a fascinating range of character builds that one can explore. \n\nThere are a few downsides. First, this game isn't the best direct competitor to GTA, nor is the open world the main strength of CP2077. That being said, the game is good at what it does, and perhaps it was unwise for CD Projekt Red to market the game as an open-world GTA competitor, instead of focusing more of the marketing material on its actual strengths. Second, the filler quests are just that - filler! Thankfully, they are clearly marked (in blue), so it is easy to skip them if you want. Third, the game's tutorial glosses over one very important aspect for players going for a \"stealth\" character build: how the hacking and stealth systems interact! For instance, you'll want to disconnect an enemy from their LAN in order to stop them from alerting the other NPCs. You'll also need the \"Memory Wipe\" quickhack in order to perform an alarm reset, and it will only affect the entire squad (and thus be practically useful) at higher rarity levels. Finally, it's been argued that mechanically, the game is far from balanced. That being said, as a stealth/hacking focused player, I didn't really mind, because I had plenty of fun things to do and to experiment with, even if the swimming-related perk was utterly useless, and even if the Contagion quickhack was overpowered. \n\nThat all being said, there's a reason why I've somehow managed to \"waste\" 148 hours of my life on this game. Despite the game's notoriously rocky launch, and despite the fact that it probably isn't the best direct competitor to GTA or to the latest hot \"open world\" game, Cyberpunk 2077's core strengths \"sucked me in\" and made for a very entertaining time.",

That sort of thing aside, the story is good, the combat is satisfying and the world is one of the most well built worlds in gaming. It is fun to play and beautiful to look at.\n\nIt's not perfect though. On the hardest difficulty, you are very underpowered for a long time and then suddenly way, way overpowered. Some of the quests are boring, but they are made up for by the more engaging quests. Also the world, while beautiful, is filled with npcs who just kind of wander in circles and their are not many \"social\" things to do. It could use more shops, barbers, restaurants, etc, just to flesh it out.\n\nAll in all, 8/10",

It's been out there for years, get it, follow the instructions and the game will run great. I had a 650ti and a 7 year old computer with an i5 chipset and I could stream the game via discord to friends and still run the game with very little lag.\n\nI've played this on all three branches, all the way thru to the end. There is a eff ton of content and I found some of the quests really fun. Yes there are glitches, like I killed a psycho and he glitched into a wall and I couldn't get the rare drops he shat out, or I had to reload a rooftop helicopter shootout because one machine glitched. It's still worth it imo, the amount of content vs running into a glitch or 5 added in with the amazing story is by far worth my time. I remember having to code my Commodore 64 to get stuff to work for 30 minutes, so maybe my patience is different.",

        "content": "[h1]Post-1.5 Update: A Big Step Forward[/h1]\n\nWhile the biggest improvements for the \"Next-Gen\" patch were undoubtedly felt by console players, surprisingly, 1.5 brought a welcome update for PC players in the form of a better living world.\n\nCheck out my earlier review below - a lackluster open world USED to be my number one complaint. Not only is crowd behavior far more realistic (and denser), but gangs appear far more active, crime scenes investigations and medical evacuations pop up across the city, and even the occasional police chase stirs up traffic. Night City no longer feels like a police state under complete government control, but a bit more like a city where \"legitimate\" law enforcement is stretched thin and underfunded, while those rich enough to make a difference are also rich enough to avoid the problem.\n\nIf I could change anything, it would be more random civilians willing to go vigilante (it's fantastic that they added this but it still feels too rare), street vendors that actually sell food, improved social interactions with random civilians (these one-line responses still feel random and incongruous with the speaker's behavior), and perhaps more first-person environmental interactions. The last of these is more icing than cake if you catch my meaning. Fortunately, these are mostly additional content and tweaks to existing systems, not entirely new systems in themselves. The groundwork exists. I have little doubt that a year from now, these are the kind of additions we'll see sprinkled in.\n\nIf you have been waiting to jump in, folks, now's the time. Things are finally looking up.\n\n\n[h1]Pre-1.5: Tarnished and incomplete but enjoyable[/h1]\n\nTL;DR: a significant step down from The Witcher 3 in almost every way, underpolished and seemingly rushed, but one that still somehow makes for a memorable and largely positive gaming experience the first time you go through it.\n\nI need to start this review with three big caveats: first, I played this game on a brand new RTX 3080 at launch, with very few bugs or glitches to speak of. Second, The Witcher 3 is one of my favorite games of all time, so I went into this game as a shameless CDPR apologist. So my first experience with this game was pure love for what it is, and an enormous amount of patience for what it wasn't. Your mileage may vary.\n\nAnd third, part of why I took so long to write a review is because I have admittedly had a bit of an emotional journey with this game. For most of 2021, I thought for sure CP2077 would become something substantially better than the \"early release version\" it was at launch. Then around August 2021, I began to feel angry at CDPR for not living up to the potential I thought the game had, spending nearly all of their time squashing bugs I never experienced and saying virtually nothing with respect to new content or features. Almost a year after launch, I feel like I can finally write a balanced review.\n\nIn a word, Cyberpunk 2077 is inconsistent. A myriad tiny gems of greatness scattered about an enormous field of mediocrity, teasing you constantly with brilliant worldbuilding potential that almost never feels realized. It doesn't take long to notice the signs of a hastily painted over facade that fails to resemble the world its lore purports.\n\nTake the city, for example. This is a hyper-capitalist dystopia with severe inequality and supposedly rampant crime. The game wants to tell us that the city sells the promise of making it big only to grind people up and violently spit them out. In many ways, the visuals and layout of the world really sell this. Different districts have distinct personalities. The grime, the glitz, the mountains of garbage, the rain, the dust all look gloriously detailed. So many clever details can be found everywhere, like makeshift hovels for the homeless, vending machines for guns, architecture and fashion that reflects history, culture, and varying income levels. Night City FEELS like a real place when you first arrive, especially as you watch MaxTac drop in from the pouring rain and zero a few unlucky criminals.\n\nThe thing is, this all plays as the background to game systems that don't reflect the setting. For one, if everything is privatized, bounties are all over the place, and rival corps run everything, what's with the exact same government-run police force having jurisdiction all over the city? Shouldn't corporate security be the de facto \"police\" near their buildings? Shouldn't gangs play that role in some neighborhoods?\n\nAlso, crowds don't react how you would expect if you can buy disposable guns from a vending machine. Maybe most people would still run, but I guarantee more than a handful would go vigilante in the hopes of bagging a reward. And for that matter, for a world with this much poverty, crime is remarkably infrequent. Sure, there's the occasional skirmish between gangs and the police, but where are the random, unscripted events like home invasions? The shoplifters who get mowed down by shop owners? You're telling me people are going hungry in the street, can get access to cheap weapons, and almost nobody is robbing one another?\n\nThe open world vs lore inconsistency is most glaring where scripted events never pay off in the open world. For example, your first job has you seemingly ambushed in the open world by a van of scavengers out for payback. This never happens again. When you go all GTA on folks, why don't MaxTac swoop in like they did in the beginning of the game? Why are there only two prostitutes in the red light district? Why is there only one romance option per sexual preference? Why aren't there any braindances not directly tied to a quest? Why is it so damn easy for V to get rich? \n\nMaybe this all probably sounds like nitpicking, and in a way, it kinda is. But it really feels deserved when so much of the game feels generic, only for you to stumble across a nugget of sheer brilliance. Not to spoil anything, but there is a series of political-themed side quests that are so far above and beyond every other side quest in terms of storytelling, the contrast really makes everything else feel disappointing. Also, one of the cyber psycho fights stands head and shoulders above the others for the mood it evokes, while most end up feeling pretty \"samey\".\n\nLastly, I can't get through a review without mentioning the main story, which is honestly the hardest part to review. The story overall is good. In fact, there are more than a handful of absolutely BRILLIANT moments that are almost worth the price of admission all by themselves. And Silverhand, largely thanks to Keanu's irrepressible charm, is almost certainly the best thing about the game. It all works very, very well as long as the illusion of choice is maintained and you don't notice how the game constantly railroads you through its themepark-style storytelling. And that's the part that makes it hard for me to review. The story is so good the first time. But once it loses its charm, there is so little else left... it's hard to ever want to go back.\n\nTo summarize, it's good, but not truly great. If you go in with the right expectations, you shouldn't be disappointed. Think Fallout 4 style missions (clear building, rinse, repeat) without the faction system, some fun lightweight shooting that might be a little repetitive, and a handful of decent surprises along the way.",

Outstanding visual award has to go to night city (although still a few bugs and wrinkles to iron out i am enjoying cyberpunk 2077 even after 200 hours plus gameplay)",

It absolutely nails the vibe and ascetic of the Cyberpunk genre. Nearly a year after it's original release and i'm still playing it, because it's a game with a lot of potential.",

However, after a year stability has generally improved (except perhaps on low end consoles). \n\nOnce you get passed the issues encounter in an early game, you're left with a game that's fun to play. Night City is huge, with some beautiful sprawling architecture.  Some of the NPCs like Panam, River, Judy have compelling and immersive stories. For the reduced prices available right now, it's definitely worth your time and money.\n\nThe game is not without valid citique, though.  I think the game suffers from the scope of its ambition.  They tried to create something so large that it was hard to make it feel like a full, lived in place.  Some of the fixer quests and police scanner quests could have been better developed. And the game definitely becomes very, very easy at high levels. I also felt that the Cyberpunk theme was at odds with the fact that many of your quests are effectively for the NCPD. \n\nStill, having said all that, I found I've gone back for a second play through just to spend more time in the immersive night city environment.",

Using all that this game might survive a bit longer than i anticipated. \n\nIt's worth a shot really apart from Deus Ex this is only big Cyperpunk theme game we've got, even still broken promise game by CDPR. \n\nGive it a try with Mods, it's worth it if you grab the game on deal since it's got a huge discount these days.",

        "content": "Sure, CP2077 suffered from stability issues, most of that was CDPR attempt to port the game to console, the PC version was great already at launch. \n\nThe real elephant in the room; I understand the pressures that come from investors and meeting schedules, it chokes effective measures to ensure quality. I find (personal exp.) that most consumers are willing to wait for a great product that's behind schedule, rather than a poor product that underwhelms in expectations at launch. \n\nThat being said, I wished that CDPR had stuck to their early production statement: \"it's ready when it's ready, and we will announce the game release when we're sure it's a quality product.\" Being beholden to investors and a public timeline screwed the team over something fierce. Delay of product is much more preferred than refunds. \n\nHOWEVER, with the hotfix updates up to 1.31, the game is decently polished already, meets expectations, and is overall a great game. With CDPR dedicating to fixing things and delaying DLC to ensure its viability and quality, they are making the right move. The game is and of itself incredible. Could there be things tweaked and more customization? Absolutely! But lets not throw CP2077 into the dustbin because of stability issues on consoles and a few bugs (remember Skyrim??) It's a PC gaming company after all and, we on Steam, all know PC is the Master Race of gaming. \n\nWhen a company has done the right thing by apologizing and issuing refunds and is actively working on fixing an already good game, I ask and posit that all Gamers alike should rejoice that CDPR isn't EA and DICE. CDPR doesn't put out products like EA does, and then not listen to their consumer base and call them idiots. It's no ET and it's certainly no Battlefield 2042!!!",

I absolutely love it.\nOf course I've got complaints, like the projectile launcher arm mod not working properly, Jackie phasing through elevator doors, the Nekomata's Scome sway being bugged, etc. Still It's set in a world of my dreams. Cybernetics being available to everyone, even to the lowest of scum, being able to be anyone you want to be. Besides the amazing worldbuilding,\nthe game is a combination of some of my favourite types of games like Open World, First-Person, RPG.\n\nEven if Cyberpunk didn't give the best first impression, I believe that, if we give this game some time it will be as great as The Witcher 3 was. We also have to remember CP2077 was released early, at the request of the people. On the other side CDPR shouldn't have teased the game so early",

Underneath the unfinishedness there is a gem of a game hidden, but for now I would wait for a little longer so you can get the full, finished experience. It'll truly be a must-play RPG game, really sad to see it reputation like it is. I will edit this review once I feel like the game is in a finished state.",

Extremely annoying. The whole reason i stopped playing was because i have a 4k 43 inch monitor. If i turn the resolution down it looks like crap. so i gave up after beating it. i have occasionally went back in and ran around shooting things but its not the same. Once you fall out of love with a game its hard to get back into i t. Still a good game. good story line. I wish the after game content was more. but it is what it is. id still recommend it, but its def not my favorite game anymore.",

        "content": "Ultimately the programming serves to communicate a game, and unfortunately this game does suffer from some bugs (much less now) that detracted from that but also some of the design choices don't really stand up. But there's still so much left to love.  It can be a hard game to grade because there are lows but overall there are more highs.\n\nIf you like good stories this game is for you. If you like compelling lore, this game is definitely for you. The lore is based in a decades old franchise.\n\nMy biggest gripe personally, is the combat. The combat actually feels really good, there is good weapon variety, the stealth feels awesome. There are a ton of abilities and perks.  Its just not very well balanced. Some perks seem meaningless and some are nearly game-breaking. Hacking can make you an untouchable god that clears rooms without ever entering the building.  So, whether you will like it really depends on what you want out of it. Its not a well-balanced challenging shooter to overcome, but the combat serves to carry the game along and make you feel like you're in the environment.\n\nOther than that, I don't have much to complain about. Its a beautiful world to go wander about. There are likeable and hateable characters that feel realistic and have realistic motives. There are rad cars, amazing music.   The story is really good. Lots of mysteries left for later too. Its just a blast if you let it be.",

I like the aesthetics, the feel, the crowds, the different factions, gangs, quests and sidequests. But when you finnish the game and all its starts and end, you see \"if only they had more time\" this game could have been GREAT. All the potential is there, i did hear they cut a lot of stuff from it before the release. I only played it on PC so i had minimal glitching, maybe 20 overall crashes, however the saves were stable and all...\n\nThis game tries to be everything at once. It got most of right. Maybe in the future they revisit the game, and improve and flesh it out more on the stuff they cut out maybe.",

In more gameplay related things the shooting feels good all the guns feel different and the smart weapons are really interesting, the hand to hand combat is terrible though, I think even the the witcher 3 with it's mediocre hand to hand combat was better. The meele weapons however feel good not crazy good but still, It's important to highlight that this game is an rpg not an fps so it's no doom either still I think they really hit the nail in balancing both the rpg and the fps aspect an that's not an easy task, I would've preffered a more complex rpg system but that is just nickpicking \n\nSo should you buy this game? Idk deppends on what do you expect from it, me personally don't regreat buying it.  I'm pretty happy with it and paciently waiting for more content",

There are an overwhelming amount of skills so the menu can be a bit cluttered. It was hard to choose what build I wanted to go for since there is no full respec and limited skill/perk points. Thankfully there are a lot to play around with. There are mods to fix both of these issues if it bothers you that much. Cyberpunk's story is really where the game shines so take your time! Walking and driving around the city feels very immersive. 5/5",

I completely forgot half of the many many mechanics of the game and found it so hard to get invested in the story again. In writing this game should be the perfect game for me, I'm still so in love with the concept and the aesthetic. But in its current state it still can't hold my attention long enough for me to do more than drive around for a while, shoot some shit, take titty pics in photo mode and uninstall again for another 6 months.",

Well, I got back home in the last of october 2021, first thing I did in Steam was bying Cyberpunk 2077. Well, I heard a lot of its technical issues, variety of bugs, glitches and things like that, but almost a year after its release(when I started to play it) [u]it feels completely fine.[/u] I'm so glad this game is existing, the experience it provide to you and to me is extraordinary rare and breathtaking. Everything feels so real, the developers aren't scared about telling people what humanity is, was and will be; this is great rarity in nowadays. Even though CD Project real f#cked up on the release, they made a great job, this game have some bugs even now and there're a lot of things to fix, but it plays smooth, interesting and... and... WELL IT'S JUST GOOD, OKAY? \n[u]Characters are amazing, some of them became my favorite[/u](same place with Arthur Morgan, Kratos, Gerald of Rivia, Ciri, Adam Jensen, Lara Croft, Joel and Ellie, Chris and Claire Redfield, Leon Kennedy and Jill Valentain wait... why do I write this??? Alright, game is just nice, characters are amazing and heart-touchable, story is good, gameplay is so great[u](if you have a fantasy it wll become insanely cool)[/u], optimization is not bad[u](if you have an RTX card you'll never be sad with this;[/u] on my sistem(RTX 2060 Super, i7 6700K, 16 gb RAM, oh and an SSD is so important for this game) i play on max settings without raytracing, DLSS-Quality and 2560x1440 and have almost always above 60 fps(well in real I have a lock on 60 fps, but whatever...).[/b][/i]\n[h1][i]Just buy it, play it, be nice, have fun, I'm done.[/i][/h1]",

        "content": "This game was visually stunning but that's as much as your gonna get. They put all their work into making the game look amazing that they forgot to make up with game play. The story is alright, people vs rich kind of thing. The game play has a lot of aspects but most of it is very similar to a lot of other games (A lot of rpg elements with stealth or going loud as an option). The theme of cyberpunk is very well made especially with how they found music that actually sounds cyberpunky somehow. The work they put into this game shows but it also shows that it still needed a shit ton of work and was released too early. The game got to a point where most bugs that were present were fixed but there is still a ton. It still very hard to play if you dont have a good pc tho.",

Don't scroll just yet though because I want to explain, this game really wants to be the best out there, and honestly if not for the fact that people rushed project Red (and was sent death threats by people telling them that they would kill them if they didnt release the game), and that YouTubers who have the ability to make or break the future of a game were saying it was bad all because it had visual glitches and one or two glitches that caused you to reload to five minutes prior, this game would honestly be close to perfect. However, because of the actions of people who liked the idea of a game coming out fast and shitty rather than waiting a long time for a quality one, this game became what it is now. Also let it be know that Project Red regularly puts out updates fixing visual and quest related bugs. \n\nMy thoughts all in all?\n+'s \nIts a good game, with lots to do and a pretty interactive story and world that really make you feel like you're in the year 2077 the city is modled beautifully and looks like a real city.\n There is a good amount to be done with your character, whether its clothing, cyberware, or character features.\nTons of quests (some repetitive but if you don't like it don't play those quests)\n-'s\n a few visual bugs and the occasional glitch on a mission that causes you to go back to a save from 5 minutes ago. \nThis is the biggest con though, it doesn't run well at all (it's getting better) my 3080 with an i9 and 32 gbs of ram chugs on high-ish with ray tracing (i get roughly 35 frames)\n\nThat's my review, sorry if I got things wrong or you dont like my opinion (if you don't, then cry about it)\n",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 is a game set in a dystopian near-future and I have done three play-throughs over the past year since the initial release. I'll admit that I'm probably more easily-pleased than most players and that, prior to this game, I was not extremely excited nor a fan of the genre, so I didn't have my standards set as high as someone else might have.\n\nI have enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077 for what it is: A game with enough depth to easily stunt on a majority of AAA RPG's released over the past decade. This statement isn't meant to excuse the fact that game was riddled with bugs, that performance issues were common for console players (I experienced less issues with this release than I did with Skyrim ten years ago), or the fact that they under-delivered on what was promised. I would say that this game is every bit as equal in quality to something like Skyrim, minus some quality of life features -- but the issue is that they promised much and were forced to deliver noticeably less due to their corporate overlords (which, of course, goes with the theme of Cyberpunk).\n\nI'm confident that the developers will salvage this title from the awful release. Currently, I would treat this game as an Early Access release and consider it as such -- because it certainly isn't finished, but all the pieces are there to enjoy the game and do a few play-throughs. Despite all of the circumstances surrounding this game's release quality, CDPR has enthralled me with the world they created and I'm constantly looking for something else to scratch that Cyberpunk itch, although nothing else does. \n\nThis is certainly a game worth buying. If you're not comfortable with something that's essentially 'Early Access', I'd wait for a sale or hold off until the game has received a few more QOL updates. But in any case, I don't regret paying full price for it and I would pay full price for Cyberpunk again were it a new release.",

Def not for kids with the sex and violence and language. Its great that you can follow the main story line or do side missions and gigs. SO much to explore. It would be awesome if the creators team up with the Wachowskis and make a new Matrix video game in this fashion.",

It would have faired better. As it stands it feels sort of empty and although they try so hard to make it feel alive. It needs interaction and the only thing keeping the player invested are quests which  there are a good number of but so are the bugs so hey. 5.5/10 buy it at a discount 15 dollars or your equivalent should be good.\n",

The good news is most of these seem to have been patched out.  When I say \"most of\" I actually mean \"I have not seen a single issue since I started playing again.\"  They still do weird things like have people txt you only moments after you talk to them, but eh, it's a video game weird stupid shit like that happens.\n\nI'm not even going to mention the quality of life additions...mostly because they are too numerous to list and frankly, I'm lazy.  I will say I was actually surprised how all of these little changes and additions genuinely make the experience much, MUCH more enjoyable on a massive scale.\n\nSo...yeah I'd actually recommend people play this now.\n\nOriginal negative review:\n\nPlayed the game at launch and despite the game being stable for me, the constant graphical glitches and T-posing NPCs wore me down to the point where I couldn't give a shit to keep playing.\n\n1 year later and a few patches later I boot up the game...surely, SURELY they fixed the majority of the simple problems, right?\n\nPlay the corpo intro and 10 minutes in Jackie and V start T-pose gliding down the street with V missing his head.\n\nAbsolutely embarrassing.\n\nEdit: I am unable to pick up 30% of the items (vendor trash, rolls of money) that are strewn about the floor despite the game indicating they can be picked up.  Tutorial mission improperly updated killing the scav leader.  I'm in the fucking tutorial and the game is already in an objectively WORSE state than it was when I played it a year ago.

The RPG elements are entirely non-existent (a choice at the beginning of the game that adds 5 minutes of flavour then and there and doesn't reappear except for once in the entire game for each choice). \n\nThe gunplay/melee is adequate, movement can feel pretty decent at times and there are times where the combined use of both can provide a unique way to complete a quest. \n\nThe open world is wide as the ocean, shallow as a puddle. It's a heavily varnished and perfumed turd. \n\nIf you want a 5/10 FPS open-world game where you meander through a horrendous main plot that's entirely on rails, having zero impact to what occurs at all, then this game is for you.",

However, I do understand that I experienced this game with some of the best gaming tech money can buy, and that is a big point. \n\nThe biggest thing for me is I played this on a CR G9, with a 6900xt. I almost played this game like VR. With that type of experience its hard to quantify. Which is why I state I am bias, and understand that I am one of very very few who can play video games on that level. \n\nDid it have some issues yes. \nDoes it have bugs from time to time yes. \nIs it a video game, and all games have those yes. \n\nThat is all I can really say, it was an emotional roller coaster, and I am beyond happy with what they have done.\nThis game isn't over, and has more coming.",

I'm sure the developers released such a raw game because of the pressure from the players. CD Projekt RED takes a very responsible approach to their games, and there is confirmation of this in the form of the fact that they are still releasing a lot of updates to improve their product. Despite of several benefits like a lot of bugs, an imperfect world, stupid NPCs, etc., this game has already managed to hook many people even in the beginning. Characters, soundtrack, graphics, side quests, the whole plot. It was great. And I am sure that in a year or two it will be perfect. As perfect as \"the witcher 3\" until nowadays. This game is for several years ahead and despite all these disadvantages, no one has bypassed it so far. I don't regret a penny and not a minute of time spent on this game.",

        "content": "INTRO:\nTruly a great game, it doesn't deserve all the hate it gets. Over-hyped? Sure, but most of that was people creating the fantastical unrealistic expectations in their own minds and OF COURSE they'll be let down. Most of the bugs have been patched out, however there are still a few that come from time to time. Anyway, onto my short reveiw.\n\nWHAT I LIKE:\nReplayability & Gameplay. I know that once I finish my current playthrough I will want to play again, but spec my character differently, and go for an entirely different vibe. Do I want to run stealth-focused with pistols, swords, hammers, rifles, sniper rifles? Sure go ahead. Do I want to focus on wrecking havoc through hacking? Sure, Do I just want to walk into every situation guns blazing not caring about being caught? I could if I want to. What I'm saying is there is a lot of flexibility in how you can play, which allows the actual gameplay to not become stale. Add that to the interesting quest variety and you've got a good combo to keep you entertained and curious about how things might go if you tried different specs and combos of upgrades etc.\n\nGraphics are great, although I do feel like the characters are a bit stiff, some more than others. Distanced rendering can look pretty bad at times, but that's usually ok since the city is packed with detail.\n\nGame runs great for me (144 fps with no problems on ultra). \n\nCity feels alive in the right places. What I mean is that busy looking intersections are busy, and backroads and alleyways are appropriately quiet. There is less traffic in the outer regions and it's nice to see the attention to detail that went into all these \"minor\" qualities that contribute to the immersion and experience.\n\nWHAT I DISLIKE/MEH:\n\nThere is no third-person mode, or even third person cut scenes, so even though you spend a lot of time crafting a cool appearance, you never see it unless you're in photo mode or the inventory. And oddly, the character model in the inventory seems very low quality (which makes 0 sense).\n\nCustomization in general. While there are lots of clothing options, guns, cars, and cybernetic mods, the game seems to fall flat on almost all of these. For example, you have a \"face slot\" and a \"hat\" but no \"eyes\", meaning if you find a cool gas mask or something that you want to wear with your sunglasses, tough. It's one or the other. There is no aesthetic customization for guns, cars and only limited cybernetics, which is kind of a big one. I was expecting much more when it came to cybernetics and synthetic body parts. Instead the system functions more like a \"Recieve X damage boost/reduction etc\" with no change in appearance.\n\nThe menus can be annoying to navigate, quests will switch randomly when someone new calls you, and the map is kind of awkward to use.\n\nOverall, great gameplay, story is entertaining enough and the game has a lot going for it, but there are some obvious corners that were cut, which I hope are improved with future updates. A whole DLC on customization or a third person mode would be HUGE.",

        "content": "After 100+ hours I must admit I've fallen for this game like I seldom do for a game. It has its quirks and limitations but all in all this game is just amazing. It's one of those games that's more of a journey, an experience, than a game. What I appreciate about the game is the story line, the beautifully created world. The characters are so well made, in every aspects. Clever use of narrative and story driving mechanics. The level of detail and attention to the small things that adds up to something immersive is second to few (I cannot say none, but almost). \n\nSome of my previous favorites that I've spent way too much time in is Fallout, GTA and Horizon Zero to mention a few. I'd say that Cyberpunk manage to take the best parts of all these franchises and combine them into one dystopian adventure. The story line and the carefully crafted characters are the strong points of this game. Also, I love the \"in your face\" attitude of the game with little compromise for the sake of double standards or what's proper and not. Refreshing.\n\nPros: \n+ Storyline\n+ The characters\n+ NSFW/L take\n+ The world, large and wonderfully made\n+ Overall experience with amazing immersion\n+ So many wonderful details\n+ Great variation in game play\n\nCons\n- Still buggy\n- Too linear (ironically)\n- Too static world \n- Some unnecessary limitations\n\nThe linear and static feel is there because it doesn't quite match the quality of the large world, the story and the characters. The feeling of walking around in a non destructive static scenery is way too present. Despite being populated with loads of NPC's and vehicles. I constantly get the feeling of \"oh, it could have been so much more!\". But... that's because what this game does good, it does so incredible good that the rest stands out because of this.",

Compared to Witcher 3, gameplay-wise it's a fairly shallow looter-shooter with gorgeous visuals, some of the best characters ever portrayed screen, legit (but not game-changing) storytelling and world-building, hundreds of hours of sidequests and distractions (what did you expect?), yet somehow, the open-world feels shallow and empty. This game leaves little room for exploration, sadly. But follow the waypoints and quest markers, and you'll find no shortage of depth.\n\nOverall, a decent 8/10. A few bugs still remain, but if you've got an RTX card and a couple hundred hours to blow, grab Cyberpunk on sale. Just don't pay the full $60, don't expect the Witcher 3, and you will not be disappointed.",

This game completely captivated me in it's world, it's people and their day to day life in a downtrodden, crime and corruption ridden city where dreams go to die. It's incredibly detailed world design and amazing sound design really allow you to FEEL Night City. It's a story from 0 to hero and you don't even realize it's happening. With a total of 4 different endings and a few collectibles hidden behind certain scenarios and such, this game is well prepared for replayability. I played this game the exact hour it released and finished it in 15 hours total UNDERLEVELED and with just a few sidejobs and quests done so, yes, there is A LOT to do, which I'm sure is communicated by my playtime.\n\nAs an RPG this game really really hits the mark for me. Lots of loot and looting, crafting, weapons unique to crafting, hidden weapons, and a whole host of perks to unlock. Even with my playtime I can't say I've reached max stats and all perks. The gunplay is as standard as it gets, although similar to Fallout 4 so if you liked FO4s gunplay you'll probably find yourself having fun with this title. And as with any open world game like Cyberpunk, you gotta have cars. The vehicles in this game are fantastic. Models have superb detail some even have details you wouldn't normally see. The texture work for them is also very high quality. The handling feels like GTA 5's but your car is less inclined to turn at high speeds.\n\nIn essence; Cyberpunk 2077 is a masterpiece and it's unfortunate development due to ambitions and time constraints + investors threatening to pull funding led to a rocky release and it's issues overshadowing what it was supposed to be.\n\nThis game has been getting frequent almost monthly updates since release and is much more stable than release.\n\nMy specs are a Ryzen 5 5600X, GTX 1070 and 16GB of DDR4-3000 and it runs fine at 50-60 FPS 1080p with 80% Static CAS mostly max settings with a few settings set to low such as Ambient Occlusion, which has no difference from Low to High but has a considerable FPS impact.\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy this game.",

        "content": "Did this game have some bugs at launch yeah. Is it still a pain to run well, yup. Is the story really freaking fantastic and the characters amazing, absolutely. This game certainly has it's shortcomings but if you're looking for a cyberpunk RPG with a rich narrative you can't really go wrong here. Firstly, if your even remotely a fan of cyberpunk as an ascetic, this game hits the nail on the head, maybe more Ghost in the Shell grunge than Blade Runner's over sided buildings in the rainy sky.\n\nI know for a fact that there will be a lot of people who will pick this game up, play for an hour and say, well there's no depth, there's nothing here. You might not be an RPG person then cause yeah, the story takes a while to get going, like most massive RPGs. It's definitely a narrative that needs a little time to breath. All the actors involved are amazing however. Keanu Reeves actually plays a full character rather than the cameo we're getting from Far Cry 6. I won't say he's the best actor in the game however. Keanu is playing the same old action hero, like Neo or Wick which is cool, but nothing new and I felt like there needed to be a bit more energy behind a lot of Jonny's lines then there was.\n\nIf you're comparing this game to GTA or Far Cry and disliking it cause it's not simply cyberpunk GTA clone, I don't think anything I say will change your mind. If you don't think the world is rich enough cause every NPC of a million in Night City doesn't have their own dedicated day night cycle, well personally I don't think that's a reasonable request, but if that's the kind detail you're looking for you'll probably still be disappointing. If you refuse to play this game due to the botched launch and broken promises due to nasty share holders, well more power too you, money is how higher ups notice issues. But there's also the argument of all the developers that poured their heart and souls into this game and how many people won't see their work because of the poor decision someone else made.\n\nAll in all, I 100% recommend this game, under the right conditions. do you have a decent rig, and are you an avid RPG player.",

        "content": "After the horrible release of this game, I decided to hold off until it was thoroughly patched and I had better hardware in my PC to really get the best out of it. Well, since playing it and completing it (main story and a bunch of side quests) and racking up over 54 hours, I can honestly say this game is just next level. It was unfortunate they released it in the state they did, because if they waited until now, then I could see this being one of the best reviewed games ever, \n\nThe graphics on the highest settings are just mind blowing. Attention to detail, texture, physics on clothes and ray tracing are the best I have seen by a metric mile. \n\nStory was great, character development was fantastic and the combat/hacking are very polished.\n\nNow the only drawback is the occasional glitch. That said, which game doesn't have glitches? I think no matter what CPR patch at this point, even if there is a single glitch, all of the armchair critics are going to jump on them and act like CP 2077's glitches are somehow less acceptable due to the launch.\n\nAll I can say at this point is this game has turned out to be one of my favourites of all time, and I have a massive respect for the CDPR team for finally getting it together and releasing the game it was always intended to be. Cannot highly recommend enough. If you are a fan of FPS, open world, RPG, sneaking, gun fighting, strategic play, then do yourself a favour and get this game.",

Those people saying \"I finished it in x hours\", is like saying the same for a game of chess. Sure, it could take u few hours or a very, very long time. Depends on how u play. Bugs? Yes, a lot, altough less and less with every patch. I didn't find any gamebreaking bugs in 1.31 so far. It started as a mess, but they have been fixing it a lot, adding patches every now and then and have promised to continue to update it and add new content in the future, like they did for The Witcher 3. I mean, the possibilities are endless, they could add tons of things and I'm for one hoping that they will. But that aside, I think it's totally worth it as it is right now, I'm having a blast playing it. I'll take my sweet long time to explore the beautiful city they created and all it has to offer.  I recommend it to all who love open world games and a cyberpunk future and wish to take the time to really enjoy it. It sure can be improved and hopefully it will but in the meantime, I won't be missing one of the most iconic pc games (imho) while it is still relativelty new and it can still amaze me with it's gorgeous graphics. Cyberpunk 2077 is one of those few and rare games, I think, that mark the technological jump in pc games, that shouldn't be missed while it's still fresh. I've never missed one of those, and sure as hell wasn't going to miss this one. If you think even close to what I think about open world games, and have a good enough pc/vga to play it in ultra, get it while it's hot. You won't regret it.",

Do a a lot of things suck right now sure but not EVERYTHING sucks and NOT everything has to be a 10 out of 10 to be worth playing. Sometimes it important to make up your own opinion and drown out the noise that we are inundated with everyday! That's why I had fun and still do with this game, I do it without having everyone else in mind.  Do I want more support YES! Do I want cut content back in the game cause it was rushed YES! And it looks like it will continue to happen and if it doesn't the base game is still the tits. If your on the fence cause some homie has some loud opinion of the game, I would challenge you to try it out yourself, pick it up on sale, borrow it and make up your own opinion.",

        "content": "The world is beautiful but the AI is dead inside. The physics are behind and they didn't get to complete all the full promises they made to us in the marketing. It's a shame. I love the world, the art, the characters, the clothing and music. I enjoy the story very much! I just wish this was a game I could live in. Like how we do in Skyrim or other open world games. If they had those extra details, those little things like mini games and animations for eating and drinking even. Giving the character 3rd person would help too. I honestly think when it's an RPG it needs these elements in an open world to make it more emersive but also we love to create our characters and see our characters. Doing the first person doesnt work for me unless we are playing a VR game to make it emersive. Otherwise it just feels like a shooter game with some really great storytelling. Johnny is such a cool character and I love being able to play as female V. What I wish there was more of was Merideth. She is the hottest women in the game and we barely get any time with her. I would have enjoyed more missions and time to bond with her. I really hope they improve this game in time. It had so much potential to being an amazing action RPG world that we all could have gotten lost in for many years to come. So far, tho, it's falling short of it's promises and we are years in from when I pre-ordered and expected to play this game.",

The number of glitches and bugs I faced worldwide alongside the storyline is just immersive and really badly affected the game's atmosphere. It was probably a wrong decision to rush the release of the game. Still, this one big negative should not affect your decision to buy or not to buy the game. It's worth it to at least try it.",

        "content": "This is the best game I ever played! Actually it was the best game I ever played until I played the Mass Effect Legendary edition. That game took the top spot. But Cyberpunk 2077 is a close second and after it there is a long gap. \n\nThe city feels very much alive. There is lots to do and there are so many hidden details. You can really loos yourself in there. I know there is not as much traffic and pedestrians around as you would expect for a city of this nature but if there would be you wouldn't get anywhere in a reasonable amount of time so there is a good balance.\n\nThe best part and what really makes this game shine are the characters you interact with and the story telling. \nThe story is better than many blockbuster movies and the characters are some of the most realistic and well written character I have ever seen. Only beaten by the aforementioned Mass Effect trilogy. \nAll of this together with the consistent first person view (even the cut scenes are first person). Makes you feel like you are V by the end of the game. It makes every decision so much harder because it feels like you are deciding about your own life! On top of that you don't have forever to make the decision if you take to long the other person in the conversation will request an answer and get visually impatient. \n\nWhen it comes to bugs for me it never was that bad at all. I first played it a month or two after it came out and I did not have any more issues than with a 1 Year old Ubisoft game I played bevor Cyberpunk 2077. And the next Ubisoft game I played was so bad I went back to play another playthrough of cyberpunk 2077 (which I wanted to do anyways) because at least Cyberpunk worked!\n\nI should probably mention that I have the hardware that allows me to play this game at max settings with raytracing on. Which makes it not only one of the best written games but also the best looking game I ever played.\nIt is for now still the only game I actually played through twice and I enjoyed it as much on the second time as I did the first time I played it.\n",

        "content": "I know I put YES on recommend, but I strictly recommend this game only if it's on sale, and even then it's a lukewarm recommendation. No amount of patches can deliver on the promise of Cyberpunk 2077, things simply do not feel right at all, it lacks a cohesive direction and vision to push it forward. \n\nThe game design is at times conflicted, for example, Cyberpunk allows you to steal any car you see since it's trying to stick somewhat to rockstar open world conventions, But because it wants to remind you it's still an RPG, there's a stat check before you can steal them. But because the game can't stray too far away on that direction without recklessly flouting convention, you can also just shoot the driver and steal the car anyway without any stat check. But also because this isn't a game about committing theft, you can't rely on stolen cars without getting an instant wanted level as soon as a police literally glances at your direction, making stealing an inconvenience most of the time. It makes the whole feature feel completely redundant, why have it at all?\n\nAt other times game mechanics are completely half-baked. Nothing illustrates it better than how completely bonkers the cops behave. Any crime you commit will instantly materialize cops in front of you, and you'll probably die if you go against them, especially at low levels. But also cops literally forget about you the minute you enter any store, or if you travel 200m away from them. What seems like a bug has been raised to the level of feature, seemingly in acknowledgement that police doesn't work right in this game at all\n\nThe world itself also feels just as half-baked, even disregarding the walking mannequins populating Night City, the setting doesn't manage to connect, V reads emails in his computer and sorts through spam like it's 1997 and hotmail is the hottest thing in town, people use smartphones and send messages and voice notes in the same fashion as they do today (don't they have computers in their brains?), and apparently brothels have access to amazing imagining technology but it's used only for sex simulations and entertainment, like, would a brothel really invest in this kind of technology, especially in a world where poverty runs rampant and human life is a bit more negligible than today? Why wouldn't brain dances be monopolized by the surveillance industry? \nAnd why is the big bad corporation is so mysteriously idle throughout the whole game? You'd think it be important to make it seem like corpos are out to get you, because you hold the important mcguffin ever through most of the game, but they seem rather unconcerned with you just running about.\n\nJust everything feels badly thought out, if this game exists, it's probably because some mighty will behind it literally crapped it into existence, but it feels like it has really no creative spark backing its own creation, there's nothing that it wants to say and it doesn't have the ambition to deliver anything that actually captures the imagination. At its best, it's a fun shooter with some crappy driving and nonsense RPG elements thrown in, but at its worse it's a bunch of busywork spread over a massive, empty set of bladerunner masquerading as a game.\n\nThat being said, I ended up putting 90 hours post-review. Whatever lack of agency the game itself lacks on its story, it's at least a little bit made up by having an extensive variety of ways to tackle combat. Not that any of them is particularly deep, mind you; stealth, gunplay, hacking and particularly melee have all been done better by other games, but at least this offers you all alternatives from the getgo, which is nice and makes combat feels not as monotonous as it could've been. Gigs are cool, they're little MGS-like outposts which you can tackle however you see fit (to an extent), and if you have a stealth build, i definitely recommend tackling the harder ones as early as possible to get some of the greatest highs this game has to offer. I also recommend doing the secret ending, probably the most fun I've ever got out of this game. Overall, it's fine. I hope that this game, as a beautiful and painstakingly crafted setting, doesn't go to waste. I want to do more in and see more of Night City in the future, either in DLCs or in sequels. I truly believe this has great potential still. As Tim Rogers said, it took them three tries with the witcher.",

Frontier internet is what.)  out of my bedroom with a ripping dystopian 2400-baud modem I can tell you that this is the world many of us wanted to walk around in.  \n\nWhile GTA is gritty and dark at times, this is the end of the world.  We caused it ourselves and we're thriving despite our best self-destructive tendencies.  Heartless monuments to human endeavor gone wrong, innovative technology, escapism to the extreme and moral choices await.

On initial release, seeing the bad press and the company's lackluster reaction, I decided to wait to purchase.\n\nSo we're now ... what ... eleven months from release? Bought the game for PC on sale and installed, filled with a sense of looming dread and some reluctance. How bad was this thing going to be? The interwebz would have you believe it's a real s**tshow in here ... but don't always believe the interwebz.\n\nHas my experience been trouble free? Not at all. I've had a glitch or two, but really not Bethesda levels of glitchiness. My pal Jackie sank into the floor getting on an elevator once, and Panam t-posed on the back of my bike that one time. But for the most part? Golden. I'm 30 hrs in and I'm enjoying every second.\n\nStory is good and combat is okay. Better when you get better weapons. It's not mind-blowing by any stretch of the imagination, but is it worth the price of admission? Yeah, it is. So don't believe the nay-sayers and the perpetual bad hype. If you had always wanted to play the game but hesitated on the news, I'd say just do it.",

However, I do think that it's kinda overpriced for what you're getting, might be more worth it on sale. Gameplay-wise, it's...okay. The \"immersiveness\" isn't exactly the GTA-level, but it's serviceable with most of it being attributed to the graphics, less on the functional mechanics. The main story is not bad with an adequate amount of character development, but the side quests are a bit shallow. I expected more tbh, but I'm not complaining either.\n\nAll in all I give Cyberpunk a 7/10, and this rating is purely on the game alone at the time of me writing this review, not taking the shitty moves CDPR made into account.",

But I need to talk about this game, because it\u00b4s that good.\n\nThe story touched me in ways I couldn\u00b4t have foreseen. Johnny's frustration with the system and the desire to change it, when there's really no clear or clean way to do so was incredibly relatable, and it put a lot of my thoughts into words. The story is good, not too long, which, paired up with some great side-quests, makes for a longer experience if you desire it. \n\nOne of my favourite aspects of this game is the customization. For your build, and for your character. Being able to play as a woman, made to look like I want her too, with great voice acting and to have me able to choose her clothes, and choose the build, which can be anything from melee to stealth to guns to sniper rifles, was a major deal breaker. Yes the game is first person, and I would't have it any other way, as there's many moments that would only work in first person, but you know how your character looks, you hear her, you see her in the mirror. And as a woman, being able to play as one in game was great for my immersion.\n\nThe gameplay. Ah, where do I even start? There's a lot, a lot of options, so as you imagine there's some hits and some misses. The melee combat could use some work, and as much as I would love to use the monowire more, the execution of it lacks some nedeed complexity. But the gunplay is amazing, the details in the guns, the animation, the sounds are great, and they're just fun to use. The katanas are very good too. There's also a lot of cyberware, from your cyberdeck to the double jump legs, which opens a lot of doors for different builds. The stealth is fun without being too challenging.\n\nThe music. THE MUSIC. It feels like a love letter to music and rock sometimes. I can't listen to \"Been Good to Know ya\" or \"Never Fade Away\" without crying a little. The quality of the music really makes the world believable, they sound and feel like they were recorded there. \n\nI could go on forever, I really could. This game watched me grow. I went from struggling on easy with a very bad build to thriving on very hard. I know I love this game because it's message stays with me and I carry it and think about it on my day to day life. I loved it from the moment I read the description back in september 2020, and I love it now, more than one year later, because it taught me to keep fighting, even if the fight seems already lost. The game is not perfect, and this is not an objective review by any means, because objectivity is overrated when there's so much soul to be seen and felt every second you play it.\nThank you\n\nThank you for everything.",

        "content": "Honestly, bad launch aside, this is a great game. It's not perfect, but it has plenty of shining qualities that far outweigh the bad. I've played it on base Xbox One at launch, so yes I experienced the bugs and performance issues. And now I've experienced it on PC. \n\nThe biggest problem with Cyberpunk 2077 is undoubtedly that it was undercooked, and that blame goes to the executives at CDPR, not the developers. There's a lot of passion and care bleeding from this game, but you can tell it hasn't been fully realized. Still, I don't think that makes the game as horrible as I've seen some people say. What we did get is pretty well rounded, all things considered. \n\nPros: \nPhenomenal characters\nAmazing main narrative\nGreat attention to many side quests/gigs\nStriking visuals, feels truly next gen especially on a high end PC\nFantastic soundtrack/score\nGreat environment design (the verticality is a very nice change)\nGenerally enjoyable combat\n\nCons:\nStealth can feel pretty lacking at times, unless you're invested in quick hacks\nChoices don't always give extremely visible impacts\nMore than a few undercooked gameplay systems\nPlayer appearance customization is present, but for something in the Cyberpunk genre is admittedly lacking\nBugs (though many have been fixed by now, there are still some)\n\nOverall, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that (in my opinion) is worth the price, provides a satisfying narrative and game world to explore, but is marred at times by performing a constant balancing act between polish and a lack of it. Ranking it as a whole, I give this game an 8/10. With more time in the oven, I genuinely think it could be a 9.5/10 or 10/10. It bleeds with potential that was shut down by corporate influence, but not enough to ruin it.",

        "content": "To begin, the game is aesthetically amazing. Night City is gorgeous and detailed and really hits the modern dystopian element. It's FPS mechanics are solid and definitely engaging. And so far the story is certainly in depth and detailed.\n\nYet after a certain amount of time there seems to be little substance. Missions start to become redundant: go in this gang's den, have a shooutout, kill everyone, retrieve an item. Then repeat. Lack of character customization, weapon customization, and vehicle customization is bewildering. Though the city is detailed, most of it is pretty much the same cause well, it's a city. \n\nAfter 24 hours of game time, I find myself not seeing anything truly unique in this game other than the setting. If you're looking for a more Far Cry style game you might enjoy this but it definitely seemed to miss the mark on an engaging RPG.",

Ignore the haters, people got entirely too worked up about a couple of release day glitches and a couple of features from the demo that didn't make it into the final product.  This is a great game and a heap of fun (on a half decent PC - I haven't played the PS4 and XBONE versions, the game pushes my hardware pretty hard, and I could believe the older systems offer a significantly worse experience).",

        "content": "So, I\u2019ll stay straight up, I didn\u2019t follow the development of this game at all. It came to my attention about a month out from release and I just bought it because I love dystopian stories and the game basically looked like Blade Runner. \n\nHow does it look? I\u2019m running the game on an MSI laptop with an RTX 2070 and I\u2019m running an external 27-inch monitor. I\u2019m running the game with most settings at the highest in 2560 x 1440 with some ray tracing enabled and the game looks and plays brilliantly. \n\nThe bugs? As far as stability is concerned, I\u2019ve had it crash twice in 500 hours, which I would have thought is pretty good \ud83d\ude0a. Yes, there is the occasional visual bug but it\u2019s no where near as bad as people make out and it hardly spoils the experience. Just because the Stormtrooper hits his head on the door in the background do you hate Star Wars? In the first 150 odd hours I had 5 missions glitch, which required me to reload and go back about 5 minutes of game time. Since then, I can\u2019t remember a mission glitching. \n\nThe story? I found the main story thoroughly enjoyable and enjoyed the array of endings. Many of the side quests were also very engaging and interesting. Some weren\u2019t as good, but you get that in any games. Given the hours I\u2019ve played obviously I think the game has a fair bit of re-playability. \n\nThe strengths? Personally, this is probably the most immersive word/game that I have ever experienced. The cars, the clothes, the playstyles, and the voice acting. The female V is utterly engaging, and Keanu Reeves is actually quite enjoyable. The architecture of the city is completely believable and feels like a well lived in city, both beautiful and grubby. I just can\u2019t speak highly enough of the world they have created, and I have completely bought in. \n\nNow of course people are entitled to their own opinion and that\u2019s fine, but a lot of the negative reviews feel like the sort of review that some people leave at high end restaurants. You go and have an amazing dining experience then go home and read reviews where people are like \u201cso bad I went to McDonalds afterwards\u201d. Like c\u2019mon, give me a break. Anyway, I\u2019m looking forward to future content and spending more time in this magnificent world, one of my favourite games of all time.\n",

And I mean a big sale, wait until its at least half off.  No point in paying almost $100 on a buggy unfinished game, with laughable AI that's 10 years behind the latest GTA game.  And the story, while has great voice-acting, ends up also being a disappointment.  It starts off strong, and ends up being a story where you barely care about the characters, and feels a bit like MGS 5, where it feels rushed and unfinished near  the end, like there's a lot of cut content that's missing.\n\nHeck this ain't no GTA 4 even, let alone equal to older games when it comes to the open-world being believable or immersive.  The NPC's and AI just feel so basic.\n\nAlso, if you have a lower end machine, disable RTX.  It still looks fine.",

I realized that every decision made changes the world around me. Everything from main story to ALL the side hustles and gigs (and possible reported crimes) just minor scale to large scale changes to the world. It will go unnoticed, if you just run towards the end of the game. However, if you take your time and explore and re-explore, you'll see causality hard at work.

My opinion is that it was worth waiting through the many bugs and I'm eager to see what new content CDPR will give us.",

I am glad I decided to overlook the games bugs and bought it. In short this game probably won't go down as one of the best ever made but it's worth a try.",

        "content": "UPDATE 15/10/22 - After patch 1.6 this game is sooooo much better and actually plays like an almost complete game.  Frame rates are now consistent, graphics glitch a lot less and the overall feel of the game is much better.  It almost feels complete!\n\nPatch 1.6 footage - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dh6-pQpNuDA&t=4s\n\nI am only recommending because it has serious potential and CDPR is fixing with patches, and ultimately I did enjoy what I played. I would say ONLY BUY WHEN ON SALE as \u00a350 is far too much money for a product that has soooooo much potential but currently (at time of writing this) is not finished.\n\nFirst video in the series here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Td-4HuXAgQg\n\nI've been following Cyberpunk since pre-launch and I was very disappointed to see just how un finished the game was at launch.  Over time the game has gotten more playable with patches released and some bugs squashed but my overall thought at the time of writing this (30th June 2021) is the game is very much still not finished.  In my opinion this could have been the best FPS/RPG to have ever been created but with a rush to market has meant a slower pickup and people not wanting to buy it has meant slower sales and more refunds.   I have encountered a few bugs since patch 1.23 that really breaks the immersion factor, examples:\n\n1. Character models sliding on a dance floor instead of dancing\n2. Character mouths stop moving but dialogue continues\n3. Car models stop rendering halfway\n4. Fallen through the map once\n5. Continuous crashes back to desktop\n\nIn all instances a bug report was filed.\n\nThe roadmap for CDPR has changed and they are dedicating this year to (hopefully) fixing the game up good and proper because when it works it is a stunning game that has so much potential.  The story is rich, the voice acting is superb, the graphics are out of this world and of course Night City is a place I want to fully investigate, I could stay there for years!\nMy hope is by the time the free DLCs drop we have a very stable game that's a pleasure to play and be a part of, also it should go without saying but thanks to the devs for everything they are doing to put this game right.",

The game does feel too short and unfinished in some aspects, but it is seamless enough to not immediately reveal where the problems lie. The main issue seems to be thematic inconsistency and lack of gameplay variety in the end, but if you like the gameplay you're given, it's not going to be an issue. The thematic inconsistency, however, is difficult. Cyberpunk 2077 criticizes capitalism harshly and points out the inevitable conclusion of deregulation and right-libertarian politics, but it doesn't seem to offer anything better than \"leaving\" as a solution to its problems, nor does it show the systemic nature of the issues at hand. The campaign works as an emotional story about nostalgia, friendship, individuality and the nature of consciousness, but not as much more. \n\nI still enjoy the game, because the main gameplay loops are particularly addictive and the main campaign is done especially well. The presentation is also exquisite. It's worth 20\u20ac in my opinion.",

I recommend this game to anyone that likes an fully open world game that has lots of gore and random ass gun fights that appear on your minimap XD Its just a really good game. (Price might even be worth it if you are able though if possible get it if and when on sale)",

        "content": "I wanted to rewrite my review of cyberpunk 2077 to give credit where credit is due. This game DEFINITELY needed some more time in the oven, and after several patches and updates, CDPR's initial vision for what this game was supposed to be is becoming much clearer. \n\nI really misjudged how complex and, frankly, broken a lot of the builds can be if you do your research.  Look up some of the character builds people have created on YouTube or Reddit, and you'll find there's some absolutely disgusting (and really fun) builds you can toy with. Wanna roll around with aim hacks, holding mouse 1 and headshoting everything in sight, zero skill required? You can do that. Wanna stop time and slash everyone to death with mantis blades, killing everyone before they even notice you're in the room? Go for it. Wanna infect all guards or hostiles with a digital virus that flatlines them in seconds? Do it. The world is your oyster and CDPR really gives you the tools to create the most broken character builds imaginable. \n\nWhile the story leaves a little bit to be desired IMO, it's the worldbuilding that is really the star of the show. If you remove the heist gone wrong elements and focus on the world CDPR is trying to show you, the game is really just about being a criminal in a dystopian future ruled by criminals. If you approach the game from that angle, everything becomes much more compelling.....\n\n..Which I guess is the punchline of this review. Cyberpunk is really what you make of it. It's a game that only shows its full hand if you're willing to dig deep, and not everyone is going to have the patience to do that (I certainly didn't at first). Rather than being a game that revolutionized games going forward, I feel like Cyberpunk tried to combine a bunch of beloved gameplay genres and styles into one neat little package, and after the really rough launch and a bit of tlc I feel like it succeeded. I don't feel like it's a game for everyone, but it's a great game for some (including me). I feel like it's a game that's easy to misunderstand, and the technical problems didn't really help the situation. I recomend it to anyone that loves sci-fi, or classic 2000's era RPGs. If you can get down on deus ex, or system shock, this will be heaven for you. \n\nAlso, the anime is great. Check it out!",

The combat is janky as fuck, even at 4K ultra settings this game looks like it was released in 2005, everything feels like you can actually see the cogs turning in a machine. The animations are not smooth at all, everyone's face is untextured and the city just feels silent. No ambient sounds, no music, no nothing, just a bunch of 3D models walking around. \n\nI do like the UI and the in-game menus, they run smoothly and look awesome, especially when you're picking out cybernetics for V. The music is by far the best part of this game, radio stations, combat music, the whole soundtrack absolutely slaps. \n\nIt was honestly a great premise and the game could've been made to live up to the hype, but in the end it's always about the dollars and artists that want to put their name on something amazing end up with this embarrassment because the shareholders can't keep their dick in their pants.",

        "content": "I can't think of any other game that I have completed that has less replay value than this one. You're so utterly railroaded and without agency throughout the plot that it essentially becomes nothing more than a glitchy tech-demo once you've finished it the first time. Every time I reinstall it, it lasts about two or three hours in my Steam library before I just cannot be bothered to continue anymore, plodding through the puerile storyline and porky dialogue which you are forced to endure. I am completely apathetic now about this game and I think that, for a game that is ostensibly an \"RPG\", there's no worse condemnation than that. Think of \"Kingdom Come Deliverance\", \"TES Skyrim\" and \"Fallout 3/New Vegas\" and others like them. Now consider this; Bethesda and Warhorse are themselves notorious for bugs in their own games but, UNLIKE this game from CDPR, those games get a pass and are rightly regarded as classics of the genre, because the depth of involvement in the ROLES that you can PLAY mean that the way you uniquely affect the story of the GAME is almost endlessly enjoyable. I must have at least half a dozen play-throughs on each of those titles. I doubt I will ever again want to sit through the repetitious and dull mess that this game is. Certainly, it looks very nice on the surface and the gameplay mechanics are fairly acceptable, albeit very derivative from things such as VATS in Fallout and other Skill Tree focussed RPGs, but that scarcely makes up for the lack of heart and feeling of disconnection from the plot in this title. Pour masses of unresolved bugs over the top of this and it's an unappetising dish when you attempt to serve it again. If it goes on a special reduced sale, then maybe try it for the experience of the aesthetic, but if you want an RPG that will remain in your memory forever, try one of the titles I already mentioned, and if you want an open-world action title, turn to GTA V.",

Personally I think it's a shame that this game got negative press over the technical issues that were mainly present in the very beginning, \n\nI've played over 90 hours and never encountered anything game breaking or something that would seriously impede enjoyment of the game (as was the case with Resident Evil Village in the beginning). \n\nThe story, graphics and actual gameplay are outstanding to me.",

I normally give short reviews, but it really feels like the team wants to turn this around and as of 1.31 I've really only encountered some minor visual bugs. The story is excellent, the characters are all interesting. Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but all in all it's a really fun game going in the No Man's Sky direction from a bad launch.",

        "content": "Even with the patches and fixes to performance and stability, Cyberpunk 2077 is still largely a dud, mostly because it feels like a cheap imitation of cyberpunk, rather than a game that was built on a foundation of it. The world and characters are beautiful, but also as shallow and glaringly artificial. Night City is beautiful, but it doesn't feel like a place that people actually live, so much as a prop stage.\n\nThe gunplay and stealth aspects are wonderful, but too often they take a backseat to a meandering, poorly written quest with dialog and voice acting that mostly ranges from boring to cringe-worthy. \n\nThe game is also completely and hilariously over-sexualized in every way, from every woman dressing like a prostitute to highly-sexualized and misogynistic advertising *everywhere*. Also, the game initially had so many random dildos scattered throughout the world that developer CDPR had to issue a patch just to eliminate some of them. They're still everywhere, though. There are more dildos laying about in this game than there are rats in New York City. It's just so hilariously corny, like a bunch of edgelord teenagers on a video game forum spamming porn pics to show how rebellious and anti-establishment they are.\n\nBasically the game has a lot of problems that patches and hotfixes simply cannot solve. I'd wait for this to come to Game Pass, or go on a deep sale, before I'd recommend anyone pick it up. It definitely does not deserve $60 of your hard-earned money.",

However, despite the bungling of CD Project Red, and the premature release, the game itself is engaging, dark, and filled with adult themes.  This game isn't for kids.    \n\nIf you take every cyberpunk trope, toss in some grand theft auto, add some RP elements, and then toss them all into a bag and mix you'll get Cyberpunk 2077.  Night city feels real, the people have their issues, the cops cant/wont help you, and the Corps are running the show.  You can choose one of three life paths, playing as V, who's down and out and trying to climb to the top of the pile of crap you find yourself in, all the while trying to make something of yourself, or leave at least leave a lasting impression.  Fade away, or die young and leave a beautiful corpse behind.\n\nThe story telling is deep, rich and full of potential,  The down sides are technical.  The game makers pushed the game out long before it was ready and they've been burned as a result.  But because the potential of the game is obvious, its hard to give them less than 3 stars out of 5.",

The story is exceptional in my opinion, the gameplay is meh(Melee weapons and sniping is the way to go if you ask me) and the graphics are stunning. That being said there are still bugs, though a lot more few and far between now. You need a pretty beefy PC to run it well, unfortunately. To give you an idea, I have an AMD Ryzen 7 3900x, 2x16gb(32 gigabytes total) Corsair Vengeance ram clocked at 3600mhz and an Nvidia GTX 1660Ti and I still get the occasional frame dip on a mix of medium and high settings. Weapon variety is dog shit, maybe 3-5 different types of weapon per category, a handful of shotguns, a handful of ARs, a handful of SMGs etc. etc. I still have no idea if armor rating does anything but I always just put on what clothes I think look nice. I'm sure it matters, especially on higher difficulties but it's no fun to be a tank that one shots everything while moving around like a ninja in the night, double jumping and dodging around.\n\nAnyway TL:DR bug fixes have made a huge difference and I would recommend it if you like the style and genre.",

        "content": "My first caveat is that I am playing this on a fast PC. I know gameplay on consoles is still a bit of a mess, and I can't speak to that. What I can say is that I picked this game up after the 1.3 patch, and I have been thoroughly enjoying my experience. It reminds be of the Deus Ex games (which I loved) with a darker story line and a much bigger sandbox. I'm only about 50% of the way through the game at this point, so I'm reserving judgement on the quality of the story, but so far so good. \n\nAnd yes, I have encountered a handful of minor bugs, but I haven't come across anything truly immersion breaking. It's a shame CDPR botched the launch of this title because, through their subsequent patches, it has become a pretty great game. I'm downloading 1.31 now, and I'll update this if I notice anything major.",

Some of the side quests had great story lines, which were arguably just as good as the main story line. I really enjoyed forging my own playstyle through the skill point/atribute point system. Its no where near perfect, but in my honest opinion, I think its a really good game. Don't listen to the hate and give this game a chance.",

        "content": "So it's now been about a year after the release of Cyberpunk 2077. I bought into the hype and preordered this game like a CLOWN, did a few side quests, finished the main story, and have touched it once or twice to see if it's gotten better. In my opinion it's only slightly. It's got a really good story, lots of cool characters, and a solid atmosphere. It's got the recipe to be an outstanding rpg, except it's all kinda weighed down by it's numerous flaws. \n\nEnemies are bullet sponges and just feel awful to fight on harder difficulties. It doesn't help that the shooting feels pretty rough. Think Dead Island or Fallout NV without VATS, it's similar feeling to that sort of gun play, which isn't the most flattering of comparisons. \n\nThe world is colorful and vibrant. So it's a shame that you can't do anything immersive like get a hot dog from the numerous food vendors that line the streets, drink at bars, or get a haircut or tattoo. Sure, you may say these are frivolous complaints but that\u2019s what makes \u201cimmersion\u201d: frivolous things to do outside of the gameplay loop. Things that have no consequence to the game itself and are there only for you to feel like you\u2019re part of the world. Unfortunately, what little immersion you manage to have is ruined by silly bugs, like cars not loading in when you enter an area so you end up parking inside of another car, or police spawning in three feet in front of you or just around a corner. They say they have patched some of these, but they seem to still happen when I tested it recently. \n\nThe game as a whole has so much potential. That said I doubt it will ever come close to what it could have been and what they hyped it up to be. I can't recommend it in it's current state unless it's on sale. It's not a that it's a bad game, but that it's so average in everything except for it's story and characters and that it was promised to be so much more than it is.\n\nUPDATE/TLDR:\nStill very buggy, like 20 minutes into a new playthrough I got a glitched cutscene where Jackie and V's headless model t-posed across the screen. Character creation has gotten better, there's more hairstyles and other options, and now you can customize yourself in your apartment. Shooting feels improved since I last played. There's a transmog system now, so you can actually dress how you want without looking like an idiot for stats. So far seems like some very solid improvements, but nothing so big as to change my original opinion of the game. I recommend grabbing it on a 50% sale.",

I guess this latest one broke a quest (NOMAD selection) so I cant complete it the same way. The motorcycles get stuck in the ground and wont drive, and the NPC cars stop in the middle of the road. So driving the most expensive car in the game becomes a hassle instead of a nice easy drive. The races quest is really fun though and I would like to see more of that. The only other thing is that the end boss for \"beat on the brat\" could use a debuff because he is IMPOSSIBLE to beat. I maxed my stats in street brawler and athletics and he still 2-3 hit KOs me. Like that dudes acting is so good at making you hate him and then the game just says haha you can kill literal armies and beat even rhino 4 times but nah hes too much. So other than that I am really looking forward to more updates and dlc! And hopefully more races!",

The gun play is fast and rewarding with some new mechanics added in that really make no difference. The hacking element is poorly implemented. I was looking forward to the arm cyberware but that was also a let down. \nThe store is where this game falls very short. Witcher 3 had an amazing story full of rich characters and interesting set ups. This story is sadly basic and Keanu Reeves cannot save this, as much as I hate admitting this. \nI wanted so badly for this game to be good. I wanted it to be fantastic. This game is good, enough. It does shooting well enough. For anyone hoping for a game changer, look else where. For people looking for fun combat, this may be the game for you. For those wanting a compelling story with interesting characters, this game is not for you. \nThis game is getting reworked every day, there is hope, but right now, I kind of feel as though my patience has run out.",

None of that matters to me. I'm not one who is commonly effected by bugs, or glitches or anything like that. I usually play games for stories and characters, and Cyberpunk is no exception from this. Although I do enjoy the gameplay (to an extent), The main, and even side characters, are so damn good. CDPR poured so much love and attention into these characters. The voice actors did such a good job, even on smaller roles. I found myself loving Claire, who makes minimal appearances outside of her own questline, simply because of her charisma and enthusiasm towards V. Things like this truly make or break a game for me. \n\nThat being said, CP77 [b] is not perfect [/b]. There's issues with the police AI, with repetitiveness inside of side gigs, and a bunch more bugs. They aren't game breaking of course, but they're still very noticeable. Despite what Steam says, I've been playing it since launch, and to see CDPR's dedication to making the game better makes me have high hopes for it. I'm a little bummed that the first DLC was just an alternate outfit for Johnny, a car and two jackets that quite frankly aren't the coolest, but I am glad they're putting their time into fixing the bugs already inside the game before attempting any actual DLCs. Some of the side quests were seriously, genuinely fun, like the Delamain quest. \n\nIf you complain about the characters being boring, did you even play the game? There is so much depth and meaning and care put into them, it's something a writer could only ever wish for. A fantastic example of this is the game's deuteraganist, Johnny Silverhand. You meet him after the prologue, and immediately assume that he'll be the villain for the majority of the game (or atleast, that's how I viewed it). But slowly and surely, you start to love him, and trust him, even if V banters with him quite a lot. I found myself loving him so much to the point where I started to buy merch. Keanu put his whole ass into this character and I salute him. (Love u Johnny<3)\n\nThere's so much freedom, and creativity, and even if the character creation is a little lacklustre, I still found myself creating a character that meant a lot to me by the end of the game.\n\nDon't take my word as fact, as I have low standards and get attached to characters too quickly, but give this game a chance before you let other reviews sway you. \n\nAnd maybe I am just a neurodivergent gay teenager with a little too much time on their hands, who cares? This game and it's universe means so, so much to me, and I'm really excited to see it's future releases and updates.",

        "content": "[h1] REALLY wanted to like this game, but can't overall [/h1]\n\nAs a prefix, I'm also hoping (but doubting) that they develop a free DLC/MAJOR update that brings everything they promised their fans. I feel like a clown for sayin it and for pre-ordering it but... One can hope, right?\n\nAs a general rule, I try to look at game from multiple standpoints and I try to look for how it might appeal to certain audiences, but... There's just so much to unpack that I honestly won't do too much, because the top reviews kinda already go over it.\n\nMy BIGGEST concern with this game outside of their promises it how one dimensional the game feels. Unlike The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, none of your in game experience ever changes the outcome besides 3 endings that might have some slight variant in their options depending on who you save and talk to, but it's all basically the same. Even the secret endings kind of feel like the same and leave you feeling like, \"That's it?\". One other minor thing you might enjoy, but rather feels lackluster, is the ending credits will show different people for different phone calls and those calls can be different depending on your relationships with them. (Though, I will say, one of the endings... The phone calls made me cry. If you get there, you know which one I'm talking about.)\n\nNow, with this said: If you're okay with a story that you can just play through once or twice before you basically know everything that's going to happen in the end regardless as to your choices; it's a fair game. The combat isn't the most amazing but it's at least interesting in some cases and is otherwise like any other COD FPS game. There are some unique aspects to the game that I will give credit where credit is due, such as the ability to hack your enemies, but it really doesn't feel super impactful to the overall experience.\n\nA lot of this may feel like I actually enjoyed the game, but that's the part of me that wants to like it. Otherwise, there was so many letdowns that it's hard to enjoy. The game had a demo years ago that far surpasses what the game actually gave you. Choices feel like you only have the illusion of choice in that you either 1. Go with the story 2.a. Fight/b. Die. Police just feel like GTA at this point but worse. Fighting styles never change. \n\n[b] (EDIT:) Can we also talk about the beginning routes?? [/b] Literally NONE of them do anything special for the story line besides give you different conversation topics and maybe, MAYBE some small decision that helps you short term but ultimately leads you back to the same story line as ANY. OTHER. BACKGROUND!\n\nBugs aside? It's just very monotonous and can eventually feel tedious if you're just trying to explore the world because there's not much variety. Yes, the stories are different but most are all as said before by others, \"go into a place, shot things, steal something, leave. . .\" In the end there's no replayability and that really hurts it's already damaged reputation.\n\n[b] 4/10. Not the worst but left a lot to be desired. Would only recommend that if you really want to get this: Wait until it's at least half off. Not worth your money otherwise. [/b]",

At the very least it isn't as bad as it used to be, but still, buyer beware.\n-Driving sucks, doesn't matter what vehicle you're behind they all feel off.\n-The story can feel weirdly paced. A lot of the \"side-quests\" should probably just have been included in the main-questline.\n-Tho gunplay (and to a lesser extent the melee stuff) is good, hacking is generally boring at best.\n-Hints of unfinished content all over the place. The devs clearly needed more time to actually finish this game.\n\nConclusions:\nI love Cyberpunk 2077. I've played it since launch, finished the vast majority of the content it has to offer, and have had a great time. Despite all the bugs, I still find myself thinking about Night City, Johnny, Panam, Judy, Jackie, Takemura, and all the rest every-so-often, something only Red Dead Redemption 2 has managed to elicit before. \n\nHowever, I won't lie, this game was [i] broken [/i] on release, and, many ways, still is. But I can live with that, after all, I played Skyrim on release and didn't have an issue, so why would I have a problem here? Well, that's because my real issue with the game isn't the bugs, it's the clear evidence of unfinished content, or poorly thought through design decisions. Stuff like (spoilers ahead) [spoiler] Jackie's death occurring so early, you barely got to know him. Or how there is no cosmetic customization after you make your character, not even haircuts! Or how certain areas, despite being highly detailed, have nothing of note occur in them except a boring criminal activity you can stop. Or how all quests are pretty much delivered through sometimes arbitrary phonecalls, instead of random encounters (tho those exist too) or a \"help-wanted\" board like the witcher had. These are just a couple, I'm sure you'll find more complaints online if you look. [/spoiler] . I could go on, but that would be beating a dead horse. The worst part about this is how I don't think Cyberpunk is a bad game... but it is disappointing to see how much better it could have been if it came out in winter 2021, rather than 2020.\n\nNonetheless, I am very excited to see what is in store for the future of Night City... so long as CDPR doesn't drop it like a rotten egg instead of putting the time and energy into fixing this game like it deserves. If you loved the Witcher, you'll probably love this at any price, but if not I'd recommend waiting 'till the next sale, at least until they fix it.",

I've tried repeatedly to salvage something from this game, but I have installed and uninstalled it so many times, my SSD is probably going to mutiny. Here's the BIGGEST FUCKING CLUE FOR DEVELOPERS: FEED FUCKING BACK. Listen to your goddamn player base. Most of us can look past bugs, but myself and a lot of others CANNOT FORGIVE spending $60 on a shell of a game. Seriously, this game honestly made me want to start a class action lawsuit for fraud. No choices, no \"living breathing\" city, no real RPG elements, etc. I honestly feel like this damn thing was made to scam people. If you feel bad for the developers and people involved, just remember this pukes make bank whether or not you buy this shit. Don't believe me? Google the average salary of someone working for these companies. WE ARE THE CONSUMERS AND IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME WE ARE LISTENED TO. FUCK WHAT THE DEVELOPER WANTS; HOW ABOUT WHAT WE WANT!\n\nBottom line: Trash, absolute trash.

I have a 1660 super and i run the game at 60 fps on high settings with a few settings turned off. The only thing this game could do better is keep fixing the bugs that occasionally pop up. great game overall",

Hating on the game in long video essays may be helpful for your tube channel watch hours but it's disingenuous. Cyberpunk is very much cRPG title first and foremost, fully voiced, masterfully scored, surprisingly emotionally gripping with a story that concludes with one of several satisfying endings some 20 or 80 hours later depending on how much side content you want to engage in. What it is not is a mass shooter and cop killing simulator. The combat design is great but come on, just play your character, stop pretending you care that randomly generated crowd NPCs are wandering aimlessly when you stay long enough to watch their full routine. You know all video games are like this.",

        "content": "I love being refused a refund for a game i put at most 2.5 to 3.25 hours, of actual gameplay, over the course of 6 to 8.5-ish hours due to crashes and having to tweak everything from game settings to ram timings to gpu clocks and volts to reinstalling to an ssd(which left the launcher open for like 2 to 4 hours by itself) and caching data in ram cache and restart to see if i could make it more than the bog standard 15 mins before the game eats shit faceplants and doesnt even throw me an error i can look up, just a generic device driver hang message(not sure for which device, tried stoc, UC and OC for cpu, gpu,ram, Bclk/PCIe transfer speeds @ gen 2 and 3 for storage and gpu); And that isn't even counting the original install and it's hours of trouble shouting(No, not a Freudian slip) into over the course of multiple playthroughs usually never making past second main mission(one where jackie dies) without out game breaking crash and ended up with 15.5 hours of play time because steam counts time spent at your launcher trying pick setting that wont cause your game to crash on load or in first 15-45 minutes.\n\nThe furthest i ever made it was just before or on my way to the mission with pan am and that was 2 or 3 months after being denied 2-3 different refund requests, where i explained most if not all of this and was told they can't and don't want to do anything to change it (i'm assuming it's less likely they'd have to pay out for a refund when the person spends an hour installing it, and after they play another hour they've already gone over the 2 hour limit), they're going to continue to count time based on launcher.exe's runtime not the actual game.exe's runtime and because my total time played said more than 10-12 hours at the time even though my longest uninterrupted playthough from start of character including time spent in creator until crash during the delamaine ride after 2nd main story mission holding jackie's corpse was only an 1 hour and 18 minutes plus 20-30 or so seconds from desktop to game to desktop again when i stopped my timer due to driver hang crash.\n\nDon't get me wrong, after making it almost 4.5-6 hours in and 3.25-4.5 hours of which was in my character, i can say the first 2-4 hours, depending on your play rate, are some of the best hours in an open world game, the level of detail afforded to linear games is what it feels like, but after 4-6 hours, depending on your play rate, you fall back into 2013-16 gta V level of quality and the immersion goes out the fucking window. Seriously what dafuq, did they even playtest any part of the game past 6 hours in? \nlets review all the tech and coding advancement in gaming CD RED has yet to implement and these are just off the top of my head\nhalo ce: 2001 - simple AI behavior tree's that can appear complex/almost life-like and can build on other scripted behaviors(e.g. sillt animations like running hands through hair or touching face or inspecting things when player sits idle in specific enviroments and places)\nminecraft: 2011 - handled spawning/de-spawning and object permanence infinitely better than cyberpunk(e.g. looks around sees no one for miles turns around mugs old lady and boom entire swat team on location whispering we don't like your kind round here in your ear, or saving civilians from gun toting maniacs to turn around and hundreds of civilians have gone poof and disappeared from this plane of existence)\ngta V: 2013 - better cops(kinda goes hand in hand with the above concept) and an interesting implementation of multiplayer mechanics that could be fun for cyberpunk\n\nAs you can see most of these ideas are at least 10 years old by now, and im not even going to get started on steam stupid fucking policies, like tracking launcher.exe runtime and not game.exe runtime, they could fix it by just changing the name of the file they monitor to the same name as game.exe instead, problem fixed.\n",

        "content": "It is 2021 and not 2077 yet, I have only played for about 6 hours and got a chance to see the famous city. \nThere is no denying that this is a real  technical achievement and a probably a very successful story line as well.\n\nThere is a blade runner like atmosphere and level of details is simply **astonishing**.\n\nI am equipped with a 4K screen basic HDR (600) built-in and an AMD 9600X GPU (Sapphire Toxic Extreme clocked at 2700 MHz and a matching motherboard Asus x570, resizable bar enabled). \n\nIn Game graphics, settings set at max 4K resolutions and details, but without ray tracing, 58 fps at 4K using Sapphire TriX oversampling which works like AMD Super  Resolution FX. \nAll textures and other settins are maxes out. There are not anti aliasing, always on by default cannot be turned off.\n\nIs it good with an AMD 9600 ? Definitively way at the top. This game will have you believe that you can only run it with an Nvidia card, well there is some business deals behind the scene.\n\nWhen I turned on Ray Tracing, performance sinks to very low fps and the worst is that RT does not live up to my expectations, it is nothing like the demo with and without ray tracing although all RT settings are enabled at max.\nThere are certainly more more detailed reflections and better shadows (graduations) with RT  but not the day and night difference demoed in some YouTube Videos and I do focus on details, believe me.\n\nSo I have spent some time admiring all those maps and reviewing the more intricate details, the ads, the water puddles, the neon lights, the city view, the sky, the architecures and this is simply beautiful with or without Ray Tracing, what really makes the difference is the DESIGN, I repeat, the design of the maps.\n\nAnywhere you look, it is full of details, ashes, newspaper that you can read, objects, even rubbish bags, it is in 2021, as near as reality as it gets, I can only imagine what it could look like in VR, if this was available.\n\nIt looks like this game was used a marketing POC by Nvidia,RT may be better on Nvidia performance wise but for those who have an AMD cards, have no fear, that will work great.\n\nSuper- sampling is mandatory to get decent frame rates with or without RT anyway if you have all options maxed and both Nvidia and AMD cannot currently run this at 4K with full RT enabled. (Radeon 6900 XT and RTX 3090)\n\nAs for the games bugs, I may not have played long enough to see them, lots were reported by other gamers, I have not seen any, maybe because the latest patch did resolve a few ?\n\nLet us not forget what the game is, putting aside the beautiful atmosphere and graphics, this is very much a standard RPG, cut scenes which can be skipped, and objectives and missions to do. Maybe I am not so fond of those scripted dialogues but the developers were clever enough to give you an option to skip them even when it is the first time you play, so a non issue as far as I am concerned, a bit like when watching a movie.\n\nSome people criticized saying that it was not the revolutionary game they expected, well they failed to see that the graphics are revolutionary indeed, but the game mechanics remains, well, what an RPG looks like in 2021, what did you expect ?\n\nI expect that a number of people will have been put off by the initial price but at the moment it is 30% off, so that was of course very welcome.\n\nThe NPGs are excellent, you can hear conversations a bit like in Assassins Creed but that way 2 levels up, better design, more realistic movements and simulations, so yes that is at the top of what you can get in 2021 that is......\n\nAdmittedly, you need very powerful hardware to run a game like this.\n\nI hope that this helps. Enjoy :-)\n\n",

        "content": "I played, and beat, this game ON RELEASE. I'm downloading it again to experience it with less bugs. I would have given it a 4/5 on my original play through. Obviously it wasn't ready for release on day 1. The bugs were plentiful and mostly hilarious. That said, I was able to play the game and I was completely taken in by the story. The visuals, music, and voice acting were quite good. After I powered through the story I kept playing with different builds. The combat had more depth than the enemies really justified exploring. There is a lot of potential to do more with the combat. I found myself wishing there were randomized re-playable missions or raid bosses just to explore and push the combat system to it's limits.\n\nThe bottom line really comes down to how much the story will engage you, in my opinion. There are a few different endings, but not too much variation in outcomes. It would have been nice to have your in game choices impact more of the games events. The characters and themes are engaging but not ground breaking. For me, it was the atmosphere. Something about Johnny Silverhand angrily ranting about the \"forces of fucking entropy\" with the music and setting adding  an emotional weight to his words that they otherwise wouldn't inspire. I don't know, I'm not a story guy typically but this game had me locked in.\n\nI had a 2080ti non OC and a i9 9700k, perhaps that contributed to a smoother on release experience? The game is beautiful but seemed hard to run. I would be a little suspect about using less than mid range hardware.\n\nI want to see more of the world. I want more stories. I want the game to ultimately succeed enough to justify more. More of the potential I saw in it on release day. Be informed about what the game is and try not to worry yourself about the bugs. I'm sure there's still bugs, doubtful anything game breaking at this point. If I could make it through on day 1 and experience an 8/10 game with the potential implied in so many ways for a stunning 10/10, I think you'll enjoy it as well.\n\nEdit 1:\nThere's something to be said about people who don't recommend the game but have clocked 75 to 100 hours in game. The story is about 30 hours. The people saying \"no\" are sinking another 50 ish hours into a game they don't think is worth your time? Think about that, what is driving people to play a game for weeks that isn't worth playing? \n\nIt had the skeleton of an amazing game on day 1 and experiencing the world, alone, is likely worth the price of admission.",

        "content": "It hardly needs to be said, but Cyberpunk 2077 obviously had a very rough start.\n\nWith that out of the way, the game is fantastic. It offers a large open world, lots of side quests, absolutely wonderful and hilarious dialog, fun gunplay, believable and relatable characters, and an entertaining (if a bit short) main story full of some tough choices. The menus can be a bit clunky and cumbersome, but they're workable. \n\nIt has a reputation of being tough on PC hardware, and it's a well-deserved reputation. However, I'm on an i7-6700k, MSI 1070, and 16GB of DDR4, and I could average 45-60fps with settings mostly on low or medium - and the game still looked great. Not just good enough, but really, really good even on lower settings. \n\nIn terms of stability, it was pretty bad at launch. Over the last few months as I finished my playthrough? The game never crashed on me once. It's definitely still a bit buggy, but certainly no worse than a Bethesda game of comparable scope. Plus, the devs are really putting work in to fix bugs and QoL issues. The last patch was 38GB.\n\nOverall, yes, I would definitely recommend Cyberpunk 2077 to anyone interested. It may not be the best game ever made (looking at you, Witcher 3), but it's a solid 8.5/10 from me.",

Sure its not the Second Coming but you get a lot for what you pay. I have played a lot of AAA games and many of them claim to be next gen, but this game is the only AAA game I played that actually feels next gen. Sure it has some bugs. I was one of the lucky ones, when I bought it at launch, I experience few bugs. And for what its worth I really enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077.  128 hours of entertainment so far. Come into this game with reasonable expectations and I'm sure you wont be disappointed.",

However, the bugs/glitches, dumb AI, and lack of in depth character customization really break the immersion. This could have been a legit AAA game but it's totally half-assed and it's more obvious than ever they have no intention of fixing it. Laughing at the fanboys that vehemently defended this title at it's release. Just glad I didn't pay full retail for it.",

I don't know what they are doing over there at CDPR, and I get the feeling they don't either.  The free DLC is three items I wouldn't of picked up off the ground if I came across them in-game.  That's your whole compensation for being lied to for 8 years by the way.\n\nSo even though I have 736 hours and will continue shooting people in the face in this game, I would not recommend it to others.  Especially after the 1.3 patch if you fancy netrunners.  A lot of those hours were spent trying to see how people and things react in the world. Surprise!  They don't.",

They are putting an effort into Cyberpunk 2077 that is living up to the class of games that The Witcher series is a part of. I fully endorse this title now and can't wait to see where this road takes us. \n\nOriginal: CD PROJEKT RED gave into cyberbullying, pun intended because this game is a hyped up joke, so now we have a half baked game that's more akin to a beta of a tech demo. Should have stayed in development until they were able to fulfill their promises. Oh, and the free DLC is a mushroom stamp to our faces. Thanks for the hilarious glitch compilations.",

The environments are all pretty bland, one dimensional and forgettable, as are the unlockable abilities (instead of a cool new ability, usually just a % buff/debuff). The combat is the same as DX with bad AI. Inventory is just plain bad.\n\nIf you enjoyed stalking around buildings, learning AI paths and sneaking into an area that has a few skill checks in it, CP77 scratches that itch, albeit barely.\n\nCombat is relatively poorly implemented in vanilla, with all enemies being stupid bullet sponges that have no tactical skills, and weapons all being pea shooters. Realistic combat overhaul is a must for this game, I cannot recommend you even think about playing without it. The enemies are less noticeably dumb when they kill and die in under a minute. \n\nIf you want a coherent, relatable, well written story, you may not be in luck. The story is messy, with badly written dialogue full of impenetrable shorthand that seems awkward by design. The characters range from semi likeable to unlikeable morons who serve as vessels for mission giving and nothing more. Characters are introduced, killed and betrayed so quickly it's all a blur.\n\nThe world is insanely unfinished. Large swaths of the map are inaccessible by default due to being abandoned part way through development. Many intended interactive elements are awkwardly removed, like chairs you can't sit on and vendors you can't talk to. \n\nThe intro to the game is a betrayal of several pre launch promises. Your life path is totally irrelevant to the majority of the game, as are all your decisions. You still go to the same places and do the same things no matter what, bar a couple of token variables flipped.\n\nThe soundtrack has some real bangers that I listen to outside the game (Dead Pilot anyone?) but there is NO synth wave, which is a huge mistake in a cyberpunk game.\n\nThe constant injection of modern politics gets very grating. \n\nGame is badly optimised even nearly a year after launch. Just runs sloppily and has a whole lot of performance oddities and spikes. Built in AA is lacking, as is the MANDATORY sharpening filter, which is full of grain and noise. Most effects should be disabled and replaced with reshade (including removing green filter). \n\n\ntl;dr:\n*without mods, 5/10 broken\n*with mods, 7.5/10 playable semi broken pseudo RPG\n*extreme quality issues, expect possibility of refund for technical reasons\n*WAIT FOR BIG SALE, over 25% off at least\n\nWELL now there's a tiny update that breaks all mods every 5 minutes so this game is PERMANENTLY 5/10 broken\n\nnot recommended.",

I bought it when it was released, but after several hours decided to wait until I had a better GPU and they fixed most of the bugs. Even after several months, it's still a mess. I never had crashes but audio, quests, characters, items, so much is just buggy. \n\nThe game could have been special but it's just all over the place. The main story line is far too short and the plot/story just wasn't that great. It got far more interesting about mid-to late game with some of the other characters, but the main story line, meh. \n\nThe voice over acting for the main character (both female and male) are bad. I partially blame the VO actors and partly blame the production team. I am sure they gave the actors zero to work on when it came to working off the script considering how hobbled this game is. Most of the other characters did a surprising solid job with the VO, but the the poor main VO's really hurt immersion, especially at the start trying to get into it. \n\nThe game looks great and besides Panam, that might be the main reason I finished it. That being said, you need heavy gear to enjoy it. I have a 3080 and maxed it out and was able to enjoy 45-50 fps. \n\nCombat, meh. \n\nThe AI. Joke. \n\nThe RPG elements are joke. It's a mess, has absolutely minor impact on character and game play and I stopped caring about it pretty quickly. Same with the crafting elements. The story line is so short, I wasn't able to level up very far. Sure, I could have went through every little side quest and stuff but that stuff was more boring that the main story line. \n\nI clothing made no sense. So you're saying a ratty old tank top has more armor than a military vest? So random and haphazardly the gear, item and weapon systems are. It felt like a looter shooter but messier. The world is just littered with stuff too. Oh, look next to the bum, a healing thingy. Oh look over there, some ammo. Made no sense. \n\nAt the end of the day, they tried to go too grand. They should have cut down on so much, stayed in their lane and used resources better while building the game. The RPG needs a complete overhaul. \n\nIf you have the hardware and you can get it on sale, it's worth a run through, but keep expectations in check.",

But only at the High&Ultra settings - turning them down makes it look... not so good.\nPerformance: 6.5/10 For how it looks and plays - it's honestly not that bad, it definitely doesn't run at high fps no matter what, but even with my mid-tier PC - it ran at mid '50s with high&ultra settings at 1080p.\nMovement&Combat: 4/10 This is where things the fucky - with V feeling like cardboard flopping in the wind. The animations are crude and stiff with the only good animations being in the cut-scenes, with T-poses, snapping, and twisting being frequent as hell in-game - and relatively common in cut-scenes.\nMultiplayer: None. It could have been quite a nice extension in the game if done properly - but it would have been perfect without it - had it been finished properly.",

It starts to grip at you  at the end when i did a certain ending.  you'll get to replay a  few of the endings depending on your choices. all together after the patches, the game is way more enjoyable, i ended up playing through it a few times, first time did it with no mods, then after with mods.

        "content": "Hard not to rant about this, but i will try to be fair....\n\nI really tried to give it a chance. Terrible mechanics, especially with regards to stealth, and the glitchiest FUCKING mess that you've ever seen. I thought the glitches would've been at least partially worked out by now, but instead that devs are giving free updates for where the useless cat in you apartment sleeps and clothing options for an always first person game. \n\nSTEALTH- it is not consistent and the mechanics of it are not made clear. The tutorial is useless so I did some troubleshooting and (short version) I found that enemies can literally see you through walls. I would reload a save after being discovered and attack the same person the same way and 25% of the time I would succeed in not being seen. \n\nLEVEL DESIGN- They force you into combat or force you to kind of be stealthy. I ran into maybe two areas (outside of the main story) where the level design was sensible. Those area were stealth specific and it was very obvious how they wanted you to approach it.  \n\nNOT AN RPG- It is far more like a simulator. This game is a big fan of taking control away from you. Specifically, you cant attack during certain situations. You are forced to attacked when there should be dialog or another option. What I am trying to say is that the devs want to play the game a certain way. Not the way you want to. RPG is a make your own choice game. This is not that kind of game. This is the kind of game where the devs are far more keen on telling you how to play the game instead of giving you the tools and letting you decide how to interact with the world. \n\nCDPR does not deserve ur respect- It is amazing that I convinced myself to spend 40$ but I really wanted to believe that everyone else was just being dramatic. Nope. Everyone was 100% right. THIS GAME IS GARBAGE and the devs do not deserve your money. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. \n    I say this because they compromised at my expense, but mostly because they lied to me. Every interview, every influencer, every trailer was a complete lie. They knew that. They all did. even the do nothing team managers, level designers, and programmers. They showed up and took those pay checks with that deception in mind. Don't give CDPR any more of you money. All of them are culpable for this theft of time and money from us.\n     The more temperate of you plead to me, \"well this and that reason is why it turned out like it did, don't blame all of CDPR for a producer decision\"...\n     ...and I say humbug. You just made yourself part of the problem. You are the reason that gaming is dying. \n\nI WILL NOT mention what I found impressive or even liked about the game-  The good parts of the game were already pointed out to us by liars and influencers (one and the same) before you read this review. Go watch their reviews if you really want to convince yourself to ignore people like me. \n\nFinal point is that gaming in general is becoming a cess pool of profit and deceit. Worst  revelation is that I just gave them 40$ dollars.",

Some shoddy writing, contradictions, and a metric dickton of bugs and lack of polish. Yet I still love it. I still like driving around Night City and shooting up the badies who appear on my radar.  I love looking at my character in the mirror and making faces, and I love being able to build who V is to me. While the pricepoint might not be what you want in this game. I can't say it is an unplayable trash heap.",

        "content": "I want to keep this review short and sweet so lets get to it. First and foremost, this game is not terrible, it's not Bubsy 3D level bad, but CD Projekt Red dropped the ball hard with this game. There is a lot missing and it shows. This game in it's current state is not very great, however, there are some good things about it. Sure the story isn't that great, there's no real emotion with V and Jackie's friendship, but you can see a different friendship grow when Silverhand is introduced. Silverhand is the best character in the game in my opinion, I think him and his side quests are the best part of the game, and where I had the most fun. Playing through the game, I had little encounter with bugs, nothing game breaking, except for a glitchy audio issue which needs to be fixed ASAP. This game also is not optimized for the hardware listed. I have a 1660 Ti and a Ryzen 7 3700X and I can barely get 60fps on the highest settings that isn't ray tracing. Some fixes need to happen that will help boost performance incredibly, or they need to change the hardware list on here. So while this game is not very great right now and I wouldn't recommend playing it now, I would recommend it later when it is all fixed and done. It is not bad, but it is also not very good either.",

The bugs were very minimal before at least for me I'm really looking forward to some actual new content from the developer in the future once all the big fixes are finally all rolled out because I really wanna have more than just the main story and not really having much replayable value.

        "content": "So, most of the negative reviews that I have read about this game are that they are upset about pre-ordering this game and how many glitches there are. I bought it when it was released on steam, and I have had no issues with this game. I do get the occasional glitch that is to be expected with a massive open world RPG, but I found them more amusing than anything. I never once had the game crash on me never had blue screens that I saw some people post about or anything of the like. Another complaint that I see is that people complain that parts of the map feel empty or abandoned by CD Red. I never got that feeling there are portions of the map that don\u2019t have things going on, but I don\u2019t see why there would be needs to anything in them. If you are worried still, they came with a patch on 17AUG21 so that may help, or you could buy the game on a sale day.\nAs for the game itself I loved every minute of it! The actual quests were memorable and unique such Coin Operated Boy, Machine Gun, and Epistrophy. The combat was fun and can be approached in many ways with the different skill trees. I loved all the major characters that you work with and their quest lines. The game having romances was something that I didn\u2019t know prior to playing and loved finding it out #Panam. I personally loved exploring the city all the different districts and just running around or flying down the highway in your car.\n Now for some things that I wish they would add to the game in future DLC. \n-Character editing after the game starts, I know its like most RPGs that once you create your character you don\u2019t change them but with the game being about literally swapping out your tech it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to edit your appearance. \n-Repeatable quests, the quests themselves are all unique and I enjoyed them all but once you have done those and all the little crime spots around the city the only thing left to you is the final mission. I would love the addition of some generic repeatable things like more crime spots appearing, a repeatable race, a bounty hunter type mission, or more boxing fights. That would give end game a but more to do to build up skills you might be lacking in, make money to buy cars, or simply to keep playing.\n-NPC updates, the NPC\u2019s you find walking around the streets look unique, but they don\u2019t do much. I would love to see some different reaction types when things happen such as people pulling guns on you, or fighting back if you steal their car, or just random drama in the streets between NPC\u2019s.\n",

I start-up, create a new character, I click next, screen goes into loading and freezes my PC about 1/5 into loading (Garbage dump scene) I had to restart, on restart my PC blue screens not once but twice requiring three restarts before it came back to my profile login for win 10, my PC has never done this before, ran hardware (RAM, GPU, CPU + thermal stress tests) diagnostics, nothing wrong, all running nominally.\n\nI uninstalled, don't bother with tech support I don't plan on installing it again, a true disappointment, enough chances have been given, CD you have now been placed with all the other publishers I will no longer buy from, can't remember the last time I played an EA or Ubisoft game.\n\nThe only regret I have is that I did not stop playing, I should have asked for a refund, in December 2020,  before struggling trough 70 hrs of troubleshooting and glitchiness  I still trusted and still like a fool gave lag.

The story is linear, without even fleshed out dialogue tree's, let alone branching narrative. The game play is...less than polished. The atmosphere is vast, and empty. Cyberpunk2077 feels and plays like a game it beta. A very good, very promising game that's in beta. On it's own merits I don't think Cyberpunk2077 deserves the flack it's getting. However, just enough of what this game could be shines through to make playing Cyberpunk frustrating. It could have been great, and it turned out a bit less than fine.",

I bought it because I wanted to experience the hellscape of this buggy mess. Granted, it's way better than when it launched but frankly it shouldn't be the way it is anyway. \n\nI don't mean to say the game is utterly bad but I have a lot of problem with it in so many places and, to be cut and clean, the version being sold is basically a demo as CDPR is still changing mechanics, spawn points of free stuff, quest rewards and so on. \n\nMy problems with the game are many: The game is not clearly defined if it's an RPG, a looter-shooter or an open world crime sim, because it's not good as any of them. Level cap is too low for the sheer amount of side content. Economy is broken because even at the end game, you may only buy 1 or 2 good cars, which there are no customization for. Crafting is useless as the drops scale as you level up so anything you make before level 50 is bound to be get obsolete.Stealth is a  mechanic that has no place in a game where even when you upgrade the whole skill tree you still can't get a 1 shot kill. Knife throwing obliterates any knife you throw hit or miss. Melee attacks in stealth take you out of stealth. Damage feedback is really bad, for some bosses you take 2 shots without noticing the 1st. Driving is straight up atrocious, vehicles can't do curves. Pedestrians either don't move out of the way or bug out and become a impromptu launch pad. Calling a vehicle either ends with it exploding because it clips into something or blows up with another vehicle it clipped into.\n\nI really want to believe they will fix it, but i'm not hopeful. $60/$70 for a demo is pretty stiff",

It follows the dark, despair, tragic, and tough to handle moments of the human condition. This is Black Mirror personified. I LOVE a dystopian cyber future as a genre. For me, it's the best. The story is a huge build up - a twist of fate, romance - and a downfall that leaves you lost. The story is what you wish it to be. I had some very real, cathartic moments from this story. It's not perfectly written, but it feels like it was written for me. \n\nGameplay can get stale - you get the same 10 guns with variations of each. the quickhacks are massive powerful, but you can \"build\" a character in different ways. The game is a bit monotonous at times with the same hacking minigame and run 2 blocks and lose the police.. As long as you can focus on a quest or two at a time, it feels fine. but, this isn't a skyrim, so many things don't feel fleshed out fully. \n\nThat said, I still very much enjoyed the experience, and the gameplay. \nDEFINATELY rush purchase double jump - makes the game WAY more fun, and play the game on hard difficulty. The 1.3 made normal harder, and it feels good, but the extra challenge and faster XP is worth the deadly AI. \n\nNow playing with a 3080, max settings and DLSS, the game is solid 60-75 fps. The game got better each patch, SLIGHTLY. I'm playing a 5th play through, and have a friend playing their own campaign on my computer. It's so enjoyable for the story alone.",

        "content": "It's simple, what's there can be enjoyed.\n\nEveryone here is going to simply talk about all the shit they hate about the game, and that's fine. Our society these days literally only focuses on the negative shit, especially gamers. I don't know if it's because we think it's funny or if our standards are so damn high or what...I'm not looking to have that conversation. (Until I make a podcast) Gamers are fickle creatures who literally have no idea what they want and even if they do...most have no idea what it would even take or whether it's even POSSIBLE to execute their ideas. I'm done trying to find the \"perfect\" game, it already came out. It's The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time...look it up. We'll never top that, ever. You cannot convince me otherwise. Anyway, random rant over.\n\nLet's talk about Cyberpunk 2077. I'll tell you right off the bat, this game did not meet my expectations, but to fair...I never looked up anything on it. Everyone and their Mom is a CD Projekt Red fan except me (I thought the Witcher games were boring and Geralt is really really bland, imo) so I didn't even have the bias from the jump like others. I just heard it was going to be a futuristic open world RPG, which is a genre I love, so I picked it up day one. \n\nIt's very true what they say, there are a lot bugs in this game. I don't even know if I ever ran into a \"gamebreaking\" bug but I certainly did run into bugs in general. Frankly, I don't care about bugs...I care about bugs that developers don't/can't fix. What I care about is whether or not the video game that I'm picking up will give me a unique experience, this one did. Although the LOOK of the city is inspired by the entire cyberpunk genre, it shows it's own take on not just technology but the culture of the country. Sometimes the game feels like social commentary on where we are headed as a society and I find that super super interesting.\n\nFrom a gameplay standpoint, guns are limited but still fun and neat. The body upgrades can get stupid levels of both broken and fun. The music is easily one of my favorite parts of the game, I listen to parts of the soundtrack on the regular. And honestly, there's a lot to do in the game besides the main story. My favorite parts of the game actually take place AWAY from the main plotline, which has it's own level of intrigue and there are branching paths depending on your characters origins and decisions. I can honestly say that the only thing I legit cannot fucking stand about the game is that the clothing options are a COMPLETE JOKE because of the lack of selection and to add fuel to that fire...some randomly generated NPCs will be walking around in clothes that you cannot pick up anywhere. \n\nIf you're reading this review so late into this games release, you're probably still interested. Give it a shot. Everyone talks about the bugs, but to keep it real, the more ambitious your game is (especially the larger) the more bugs. Everyone bitched and moaned when they kept delaying it FOR the bugs...it honestly doesn't make any sense to me. I believe I ended up putting something like...70 hours on the launch patch. There's no doubt in my mind that even though this game did not get delivered polished, at least they're still working on it and it's very much still worth $60.\n\n(Update: It makes me insanely happy that they're still working on this game. So many things have been fixed and added, as I expected. Winding down towards finishing my third play-through, cannot wait for the DLC. I truly hope all you Witcher circlejerkers give this game a chance because I want another game in this world.)",

NPCs behave strangely, quests break, items aren't interactable, textures freak out, and so on. There was an incredible amount of hype around the game before its release, and it did not live up to that hype due to many issues. The game is undeniably flawed.\n\nHowever, I think that it still offers a fun gameplay experience. I have personally not run into any game-breaking bugs that corrupt save files (although I know they exist/existed), and because of that I had a lot of fun running around the world and doing random encounters, side missions, and story missions. I chose out a play style I like, and had a great time with it (stealth, cool, silenced pistols, and blades). All in all, it was a fun FPSRPG. Moreover, the devs are continuing to work on the game. The most recent patch, 1.3, introduced a lot of quality of life changes and bug fixes, as well as game balance improvements. The game is and has been improving on a technical level, and I respect that.\n\nI therefore recommend this game. I only hope that the devs are getting to work normal hours when they work on this game, rather than having to crunch for patches nearly a year after the game's release.\n\nEdit: wrote the patch number incorrectly. It is now corrected.",

Photomode was a constant companion, and though I don't think that will appeal to everyone, I love that I have a lot of memorable shots of the game, because it looks so damn good and the characters are incredibly expressive and awesome.\n\nI also thought the difficulty was too easy, the balance wasn't great, the character progression could use some work, and the open world wasn't fleshed out enough. All things that didn't ruin my overall enjoyment, but it fell short of the gameplay greatness I'm sure the devs wanted to achieve. \n\nThat said, improvements are being made, modders are doing some great things, and this is just the first instalment of what could be a long-lived and amazing IP (Witcher 1 was certainly no brilliant success). So we'll see what happens.\n\nConcerning technical aspects, I have a strong though not top tier PC, and I had no crashes, FPS was fine (I don't need 100 frames on 4k), bugs were minimal and never game-breaking as far as I made it-- around 60% through before I paused to heal an injury--and I was quite happy with the experience I got. \n\nI'd give it an 8/10.\n\nIt could be a 9/10 or a 10/10 if they continue to polish the rough edges and add expansion content that fleshes out the open world-- particularly stuff like gang faction systems with unique rewards, a survival/high difficulty mode, more random events including more hostile encounters, and as much cosmetic customization as they can stuff into the game. \n\n\nFinal Note: To all the people going on and on about being lied to: Get some media literacy. CDPR marked the demo and detailed teasers as a work in progress, which frankly should be obvious in the first place. Big games change prior to release in many situations, and if you don't understand that then you are very naive, perhaps wilfully so. Maybe you were a CDPR fanboy, I don't know, but it's kind of hilarious seeing so many hurt feels and rants about ethics, as if these people have never dealt with a complex artistic project (a.k.a. big game), or understood what marketing does.\n\nWhich isn't to excuse some of the shittier things CDPR did, like the old gen launch state or review embargo. But those things rarely get the focus for criticism. Instead so many of these gamers complain about the devs talking about what they were working on, and they get so worked up about the fact that a video game disappointed them that they use rhetoric to try to tear down everything the devs have done. \n\nI swear it's like they were born yesterday.\n\n\nedit: Ignore my number of hours played, I mod Cyberpunk now so I have a ton of time logged in tinkering stuff. My actual playtime is probably about 150 hours with a good half of that representing exploration with photomode.",

It feels like they are working on features that are not really important and not really trying to make up for the dumpster fire that was the launch of the game.\n\nThe major issues of the game such as the police, the lack of variety, physics when driving are one thing, but they should really also look at working on the features they promised before launch. By doing that they may also reclaim some of the reputation they have tarnished so much.\n\nI have spent 100 hours on this game, (Mainly trying through pure belief in this game and hoping to find true value in this game), but sadly I rate this as average and cannot suggest this to anyone, even if I believe the potential is so high. I guess that make the fall that much greater.",

        "content": "Looking beyond its obvious flaws that I probably don't need to reiterate, Cyberpunk 2077 was a great experience. The appeal is in its story and characters, which make the game immersive and bring Night City to life. It is not hard to fall in love with the characters, who are so well developed. The voice acting is incredible, the writing is amazing, the dialogue is realistic. It is foolish to overlook the hard work the team did put into the game, because it is clearly there. The gameplay is good. There are a variety of guns and cybernetic enhancements to play around with, but that variety isn't very large. It is, however, sufficient enough to allow players to choose their own play style. The scenery of the game is beautiful; the map design is very well-planned and CDPR did a great job of bringing 'cyberpunk' to life (and I will add here that there was a satisfactory amount of Blade Runner references in the game, kudos to them). The city is so beautiful and intricate, I often find myself abandoning fast travel to drive my vehicles instead.\n\nI have played this game on both PS4 and PC. On PC, the game runs well. While crashes do occasionally happen, or you run into a humorous bug here and there, it is nothing game-breaking and it doesn't tarnish the experience. It's disappointing to think of just how incredible and successful this game could have been had it not been released so prematurely and with such poor decision-making. Putting that aside, I still recommend this game to those who are more focused on story and lore, because this game does deliver in that department. There are still flaws, I feel like they could have gone a lot further with it. It feels like there was a lot of cut content and that a lot of the characters got abandoned once their missions were over. It is still worth playing in my opinion. Maybe not at full price though.",

The world-building is so immersive I enjoyed driving around taking in all the sights (although driving mechanics are admittedly a little wonky, although i actually thought it just made it more fun, BECAUSE I THRIVE ON CHAOS OK?!). While some have complained the main story, while compelling, is too short, I would argue that the amazing side quests with memorable characters like Panam, Judy, River, etc. add quite a bit to the story. Sure you can do a quick run and finish the main campaign relatively quickly, but why miss out? There's a reason I have almost 200 hours on record when writing this. There's actually quite a bit to do in Night City. Also, I personally haven't run into any bugs (although I know it's mainly for console players where this has been a problem). \n\nMy biggest criticism would be that I would prefer more character cuztomization, or at the very least the ability to change appearance during the game (seems logical that in a place like Night City, one should be able to go to get a haircut, tattoo, and/or modify body parts whenever they wanted, as long as they have the $). But I can live with that. \n\nSeriously though, I have really enjoyed this game. It has become one of my favourites :)",

To my eyes all I saw was a few bugs quickly fixed and a bunch of impatient crying babies. CDPR put out another masterpiece that has brought me joy and entertainment for over 280 hours now. I'm still going with easily enough content for multiple playthroughs. I'll admit my expectations put this game far above The Witcher 3 and on depth of character and storytelling it didn't even reach par but given the level of perfection The Witcher 3 reached as an RPG I see now those expectations were unrealistic. Still that said, this is by far one of the greatest RPGs in the history of PC gaming.",

Traditional leveling (level 1 to 50) based on total experience\n2. Situational leveling (level 1 to 20) based on using specific skills (ex. pistols)\n3. Street credit (level 1 to 50)\n* Multiple endings based on your choices\n* Rich and picturesque environment\n* Lots of the traditional types of weapons (rifles, light machine gun, knife, pipe, etc)\n* Weapons can be upgraded, but this is not a large plus as it does not have much impact and upgrading multiple times quickly becomes too expensive.\n* Some romance options, although they mimicked real life in that they have one bang at the start, but no significance romance after.  Repeated romance requires repeat payments.\n* More adult and gritty environment.   Refreshing with many games being watered down prudish kid level topics.\n* Auto travel between map points that you have already gotten too.  Gets rid of drudgery.\n* Not a puzzle game.  I play to adventure, not to solve random puzzles, so this realism is a big plus for me.\n* Lots of side quests, and options for where to invest your experience.  I felt like I more than got my money's worth.\n* Easy mode really IS easy.  I love that they really do offer you an easy button if you like that play style, and plenty of challenge if you prefer.  Makes for both a pleasant initial experience, and for replay as you learn the system.  Some of the other games could learn from this one.\n* Quests for the most part are well marked and documented.  I dislike spending $40 on a game, and then spending half my time breaking immersion by looking up who and where I'm supposed to go next to avoid hours circling through the same area talking to everyone.   Cyberpunk 2077 had a good balance for quest guidance.\n\nCons\n* I did experience some bugs.  Only one of them (mission \"dredged up\") hurt my experience though, by stopping me from completing all the missions in Watson.  A few looting issues for mechanicals, but some of them solvable through reloading.\n* Crafting is pretty much a joke.  Don't spend a bunch of skill points to get there.  At end of game, most of the legendary crafting patterns have joke DPS.  The few that have decent DPS take seemingly random rare guns or items I could not find to complete.  You'll be better spending your points elsewhere and buying good items from the stores.\n* The game will let you pick up or buy ammo AFTER you are already at max.  If you are at 100 rounds, and you cannot hold more, the game should tell you that.  In real life, you would know if you cannot hold more ammo and would not spend a bunch of money to buy something that never ends up going into your inventory.  Seems like a silly oversight with how much they did get rights.\n\nNeither Pro nor Con\n* Sure, some of the doors are perma locked.  I don't really see that as a con.  This is a whole city, not a few caves or wilderness locations.  I feel they provided plenty of content for what I paid, and I don't blame them  for not having fleshed out every single room in every building.  Sure, they could have come up with some random generation system, but that could also mess with the leveling mechanics if those all had weapons or stashes, or it would just be boring if you broke into a bunch of them and there was nothing there.  Bottom line is that this felt open world enough to me.  This is not a linear rail shooter.  You get a lot of choices about where to go next.\n\nSummary:  Loved it.  Good mix of classical leveling, action, and story line.",

I'm in a privileged position with Cyberpunk I'm playing on a high end PC with a 3080 so I got to experience it more or less as intended unlike those on console or I presume lower end PCs. In any case, yes I would still recommend this game. The story and characters have had me wrapped up since release, and it just doesn't get old for me. I love the RPG elements, Night City, the cars, etc. No matter what way you slice it, this is a huge curated world with an interesting story and it's all carefully draped over highly compelling gameplay.",

        "content": "There it is... Just reached over 1,000+ hours in Cyberpunk 2077... :)\nUPDATE: 2,500+ hours now.\n\n\"Can't stop diggin' Night City!\" - as Jackie Welles says during the prologue :')\n\nThe game could have been better, and I KNOW it will be better, yet I still enjoy it for what it is. Living that mercenary fantasy - a cybernetically-enhanced badass!\n\nEDIT: After Patch 1.5 (and now 1.6) the game is simply stunning! It's fundamentally better. I love the energy of CP2077's new Game Director Gabriel Amatangelo, that man has stepped up, giving the game what it deserves. Soon we'll be getting a complete re-work of the police system, along with vehicle-to-vehicle combat, bigger MaxTac presence and other highly requested features by the community. I can't wait.\n\nNow, I could write a huge, in-depth review of why I love this game so much, despite all the backlash it's gotten from various fans, false promises / false marketing, etc... we all know that story, right?... But my game hours should speak for themselves. This is just my opinion.\n\nIn short, this game's graphics (especially when maxed out in 4K, HDR, DLSS and RTX, it becomes a technological marvel. Its atmosphere, immersion, deep & dark story, complex lore, characters, soundtrack, hidden secrets and overall gameplay replay-ability have left their mark on me. There's a certain comfort to Night City that I can't quite describe. Which is strange, because the city itself is a f*cked up place. Driving at night through the city streets, the various districts, the Badlands, etc... feels nostalgic and somehow relatable. It reminds me of the days when I was younger, half-asleep in the backseat of my family's car, feeling safe, subconsciously listening to the radio music playing in the background at midnight as we drove past the busy city streets to our destination, going on a road trip, away on holiday.\n\nI love trying out different builds, tactics, choices, reading everything, looting everything... I like to roleplay my characters' builds based on my chosen lifepaths. There is Nomad, Streetkid and Corpo. Each has a different intro, along with different dialogue options during main / side quests / gigs which either gives more insight when dealing with the respective faction, or unlocks entirely new, unique outcomes. The only other games that have left me in a similar state of passion and addiction have been TESV: Skyrim, Mass Effect trilogy, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, and a few others... Even now, after 2000+ hours, I'm discovering new things!\n\nThere are many great games that I've re-played numerous times in the past, but not to this extent! And certainly not in such a short amount of time. There's also mod support, which is pretty cool! UPDATE: As of Patch 1.6, we have official mod tools. REDMod has been released, which, with time, will bring Bethesda-level modding capabilities to CP2077. I've been playing since launch, and somehow I've come across very little bugs / glitches. Also NO crashes! Lucky me, I guess... :) Makes me wonder if the game really is as buggy as it's made out to be... The less Reddits / social media posts I read, the more I enjoy the game. But this is just my personal, biased experience running on a high-end PC.\n\nI'm just here to leave my positive review and show my support. I should have done it a long time ago, but I thought I'd leave it until I hit a big milestone... Which is now, as of this review, 1,000 hours! What a beautiful number! Maybe now my review holds more \"weight\" ... I hope more people decide to try the game for themselves and not have their experience ruined by the internet... I know CDPR are hard at work with the new patches, free DLC and expansion(s), I've been watching Pawel Sasko's streams (Quest Director at CDPR) and I trust him over any leaks / speculations and other crap you might come across on the internet...\n\nI know for a fact that there's still many more hours left for me in this Cyberpunk 2077 universe. :) Possibly hundreds! Looking forward to the expansion, Phantom Liberty. I hear its size will be in between The Witcher 3's Hearts of Stone / Blood & Wine expansions. For the best news updates with perfect track record, I suggest Tyler McVicker, Kazuliski and LastKnownMeal. Check them out on YouTube. They are also great with lore.\n\n\"A Thing of Beauty, I Know, Will Never Fade Away\" - SAMURAI :')",

Most of the characters are likeable, though I personally wasn't a fan of Johnny (The actual character, he is very well written and a good character.) The gameplay is very fun imo, and as someone who enjoys running and gunning \"DOOM\" style, it fit me perfectly. There are also plenty of different combat options like stealth, blunt melee, bladed melee, and even hacking or diplomacy.\n\nOverall: I recommend Cyberpunk 2077\n\nPS: You can pet the wild cats in the game",

Snipers are CU next tuesdays, occasionally frame rate drops (when walking through market areas with lots of NPCs), but I'm finding that I'm loving the game - and something I didn't really think about the first time I played it, the sound design is absolutely amazing. Just weird noises as you walk around the city, ebbing and flowing, and tension is well synchronised - lush.\n\nHaving the knowledge of how bad things will get so spending a lot of time building V to be tough as nails, but know that he's still going to get wasted every time a sniper gets his sights on him,  the immersion in the game that I'm experiencing this time round is so strong that I can do nothing but recommend this (again).\n\nPlayers who expect everyone they meet to stop what they're doing and have a conversation with them will be disappointed. Most people in Cyberpunk 2077 will tell you to feck off, which is the level of realism I was looking forward to with this game.\nThere are downsides. But I'm loving it.",

        "content": "It's like this was written by someone who had read a lot of cyberpunk but had no idea how to write it. The themes, characters and plot elements are all competently regurgitated but offer little depth. One of the game's few original touches is a forced edginess reminiscent of a first-year-philosophy dropout's blog about \"fighting the system\", and that's about as fun as it sounds. The writing tackles many mature themes but lacks much maturity itself.\n\nCombat's pretty good and the world looks incredible (if you have a decent setup, at least) but many other aspects are underdeveloped - including skill-tree, AI, merchants, driving and the mostly pointless 'life path' options. The lack of access to no-brainers like hair cuts and flying cars is truly baffling.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a hardcore cyberpunk fan - and you can tolerate Keanu Reeves rattling off cynical stoner soundbites every ten minutes.",

That being said lets add alittle sugar to this salt. So far the patches have pretty much put the game back together and made it playable with less immersion breaking, despite my disappointment its still a very good in terms of action and rpg elements. tho I am concern on the scarcity of patches or news of new content as of late, there is still plenty to explore and do in game. Give it a try but maybe wait for deal on the price.",

I had roller coaster feelings about this game, but in the end, I'm very happy I put in the time and finished it.\n\nTip: Do everything you want to do before the end.

It's extremely visually impressive, the first couple hours of the story are genuinely good and I found myself being really emotionally invested in the characters the game introduces in that time. However, after a certain point the gameplay loop becomes transparent and repetitive, and it's hard to ignore the sheer array of things CDPR promised that were not incorporated in the final product. If CDPR pulls a Hello Games and works on adding in new mechanics I might change my mind, but for now it will remain uninstalled.",

        "content": "I recommend the game but i would also like to note my disappointment with some aspects of it.\nI honestly believe the world is a work of art and every nook and cranny does feel hand crafted and a testiment to the imagination of the studio. Ive not seen such a brilliantly realised world before. However as many in other reviews state its fairly surface level , you cant interact with much of it in any way. and the world crowd npcs seem so weirdly out of place and unconnected . The main npcs and side characters however are all memorable and interesting even if i didnt like all of them bar pan am and jackie. I enjoyed the interactions with silverhand and liked the whole in my head thingy going on.\n A major gripe for me is that crafting felt pointless, skills and upgrades are lacklustre in my opinions. \nCharacter customization is both good and bad . You can slider and changes alot of face stuff but you cant be a hulking brute or a skinny ninja assassin looking waif. Like i wanted a tall muscle bound fist fighter with silver cyborg arms and my actual character looked like a normal dude . Almost 95% of clothes you can get dont fit the character well at all, and i get the 80s neon aesthetic which i love but i mean the clothes look ill fitting and weirdly sculpted on both male and female and there was a severe lack of variety compared to the npcs i see walking around.\nThe voice acting is good from all involved overall though i prefer male V's delivery personally. Story is very cool and the major side missions are excellent. The minor side quests are pretty standard but thats ok i guess. Hacking and quick hacks didnt have enough variety and at one point i just stopped bothering and switched to shotgun and just walking calmly around one shotting enemies as their AI was so slow and poorly scripted it didnt matter. ( things might have improved since i last played) but overall the AI from all creatures / characters/ police/ cars/ street crowds was just shockingly poor.\nMelee combat was a joke with the death animations triggering all the time and the same way.. made me just again give up and shot people instead. \nSome of my best times in the game were not interacting with combat and systems at all (the games weakest point) and just driving around on my bike exploring and soaking up the amazing sound track trying to forget about my day. So there is a a good game here and i recommend it just to experience the world. Just wait for it to go on sale or when they add more features.  Ive alot of hours put in from a couple of play throughs and again alot of that is just exploring and chilling. \nI hope to return again with a big DLC etc \n\n",

        "content": "In effect this is Witcher3 wild hunt in futuristic settings, the story is great, I could engage with the characters and liked the overall setting.   Combat is fun, I found the most enjoyable for me was stealth, rifle, pistol and blade, the mono wire is also fun.   They improved the driving, but I prefer using the motor bikes in first person.   \n\nYou will see a lot of hate directed at this game, and while there is truth that the game was over-hyped and promises made that were not fulfilled it does not take away from what is a very good game.    I have the impression that SJW type people have it in for the game and the company that made this game which is why the hate often seems like an organised campaign.    Perhaps because the dystopian future that this game is based on is starting to happen in real life and that scared certain people who desire that outcome.\n\nI do not have a very good graphics card. 1060 GTX but it runs perfectly fine on the recommended settings for the game.   the detail of the city is stunning and you can forgive the odd duplication of a person walking past you.    I would love there to be more to do and making it a real role playing experience, perhaps I should start looking at the mods, but I will wait until all of the DLC's have dropped.   However why are the DLC's taking so long?\n\nTLDR:   You will not be disappointed if you like a deep story based game.",

        "content": "Here is my take on Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nBefore we dive in, a little bit of context to my review. I played this game only very briefly during its initial week of release. I got to the point of meeting Keanu's character, maybe just after, on street kid playthrough, and stopped. Cut forward to a week or so ago, and I have dived back in.\n\nI genuinely enjoy this title.\n\nThe reason I enjoy it so much, is the story. Whether it is side quests, main, or whatnot, there is a lot of time and effort put into making sure each moment isn't one of those that make you wish you could skip it. There is the option to do so, which is nice for when you die, but some large titles, have plenty of moments where you are telling your monitor to \"shut up\" because its dead analogue. This game reminds me a lot of Yakuza for that, in terms of being in a open world scenario,  with the scenery being more high-tech advertisements, buildings, and then other small vendors and stores surrounding nearly all free-space. \n\nThe other connection I bring to the Yakuza series (especially the newer ones, like 0 and 6, even the kiwamis) is the graphics. Yakuza cutscenes are some of the more beautiful cutscenes in all of gaming, and Cyberpunk takes that style of graphics, into the entire gameplay. Ive noticed that it gets even better during cutscenes, as things are being focused, and not just a giant junkyard gunfight (where it can get ugly and laggy sometimes). It is spec relevant, so dont expect a gtx 960 and i3 to give you lifelike visuals, but most should have a great visual experience. \n\nFor me the gameplay is right up there with the graphics. You have large skill trees, weapons and mods, mods for your body, clothing, food items, junk (decoration or meme items for me). The combat is somewhat complex in means of knowing weakness, using correct mods and weapons for the range and scenario, grenade detonation time. I would say also that the rarity system and such for cybermods or weapons and mods, are comparable to that of borderlands and destiny, but with a little extra on top. The quick-hacks also play a large role in the game, as for the most part, unless you are one of those weirdos that grinds out the side quests and comes to the story line already God, you wont be able to just run in and shoot up everything. You will have to take cover, peek that cover to pop enemies, quick hack and short circuit somebody to lower health, reboot optics or memory wipe them to give you some time to think and recover. \n\nI think to wrap it up, I want to say great job team, on producing an amazing game. My only complaint is the lack of romantic relationship possibilities (not joytoys, those are one and done) like Panam, Judy, Kerry, etc. It would be nice to go corpo route one playthrough and pickup Judy, or another playthrough as Nomad, and find some random city chick, ya know? Something with some story. Also, it would be nice to be able to go back and interact with your \"partner\" and talk about things, go on a random trip to the city to watch a movie, take a drive and look at the stars. It doesn't have to be more sex, because there are mods for getting different skins for joytoys, but im talking true relationships. Aside from this, I have next to no issues with the game, and for what we were provided here, I think the negatives aren't worth a concern if you are a new player, as you are going to have a blast with the other things. If you had the option to eat some of the best cookies on the planet, but there might be one of the dozen that is half burnt, you wouldn't at least try it?\n\nPS.- My typing is garbage, and my keyboards glitchiness doesn't help. Somethings may be spelled incorrectly, have more letters than it should, bad punctuation, but im not fixing it, so dont comment about it lmao.",

Things are broken. Essential story characters disappear, or get stuck in hallways. Sidequests get locked off because the NPC simply doesn't exist for no reason. The crafting system is jank. The romance options are literally only 4 characters, 2 per player gender, and the story obviously leans into one, and they just decided not to make one of the critical characters bisexual, or rewrite one of the endings. The background-related options have no impact on the outcomes or story. I honestly only spent this much time because of the sunk cost fallacy, and the hope that it would get less broken as I played. Don't buy this game, especially not for full price.",

Combat feels clunky at first but gets better as you unlock more things. No its nothing special but you can decided if you want to go only fists or just hack everyone. On that note to the people going \"Might aswell not even bother with guns. You can just kill everyone by hacking\" No shit. Its a game where everyone has a computer in their head. Hell watch dogs you could complete just about every mission without setting foot in the area.  Gotta say. Me personally i loved popping everyone with a highpowered revolver. Turned most enemies to mist in one shot. (side note. did a mission where i walked in on father and son edditing something. They started talking and i accidentally clicked and shot the father. Rest of the conversation was the son crying and giving me the information i wanted. Game won some points with me in that moment.) Honestly crafting isn't even a must but can be completely broken if you put time into it. However you can still be over powered just going around the city from things you buy or find. Also the game does reward those who explore. Found one of the fastest cars by accident while exploring. Also the legendary Monowire. If you don't have time to explore.... Youtube.\n\nAll in all. Story was good in my opinon. Better then most of the crap coming out nowdays. Combat was clunky at first but enjoyable over all (to the ones saying its repetitive.... no shit. Name a open world game where combat isnt repetitive) Bugs are there. Only ones i ran into were people walking across the room but never actually walking. and seeing trees through walls a couple of times.\n",

Character design is very good. The game looks phenomenal. However it's not without its infamous shortcomings which are exclusively to do with gameplay elements.\n\nTo name some creases, vehicle handling is a bit silly and could do with the tweaks. Fist fighting could be worked a bit better although it is playable (Just don't expect it to be like the Witcher series at all or you'll be disappointed as your level does matter in contrast to the Witcher where you could beat the whole lot of fistfights before really levelling up much at all.)\nIt is also slightly frustrating that you can't necessarily max out your character with all the perks as you don't get enough perk points to max out. While understand this was meant to be more of a class build kinda of system it does mean that there are some parts of the story which will suffer, for example if you invest entirely into combat and your intelligence or tech is low there's some important choices you'll never be able to do so you have no choice in some of the outcomes at all. I would recommend looking at some builds on youtube or elesewhere to help you understand how to make the best of this system.\n\nWith a bit of ironing out the creases this game could really be among some of my all time favourites.",

The only thing that actually falls short and really bothered me was the RPG aspects were not really there until basically the end of the story. That was the point when making different choices mattered, many expectations were put on the game at the end of the day, but RPG again was not there so its a little world where you will love it, get into the lore a little bit and appreciate it or you can focus on the stuff you can't do and pick apart each little detail if that makes you happy.",

BUT, I am gaming the PC-version and I have to say, I am NOT disappointed. I will try to keep it short, because it is late, though there is so much to say. Briefly, the great strengths of this game are definitively the production design, in that context the world and at the end of it all the story telling. Never experienced such an immersive story telling from the ego perspective (amazing dialogues, amazing set pieces, especially the more intimate ones) and even Night City itself is much more alive and interactive than I was afraid it would not be. That aspect is certainly connected to the well crafted story telling or let\u00b4s say the well directed narrative. What was already a nice feature in GTA, Cyberpunk does even better. Every \"casual\" encounter within the world is a thought out quest in itself, which in turn let\u00b4s your brain experience the world as more interactive, you get the feeling that you can enter a lot of buildings and it is a clever way to let the player explore the world in a more fluent way. Could the game have been more complex in terms of game mechanics? For sure. Though the action feels kinetic, dynamic and very entertaining (I am a huge fan of the guns and also the feeling for your character\u00b4s body). Could it have been more ambitious in its implementation of features? Also sure. But is it a disappointment because of that? Not at all. To put it in a nutshell, it is basically The Witcher 3 in a beautifully crafted sci fi / cyberpunk setting. So if you liked The Witcher 3, you are going to like Cyberpunk (or maybe even love?), despite some bugs (nothing near as bad in the PC-version as in the console versions). Forget the controversy and enjoy a very compelling single player experience!",

        "content": "I really enjoyed my time with Cyberpunk 2077. Perhaps my most salient takeaway is: enjoy the game for what it offers, rather than be upset for what it doesn't offer. \n\nI think the marketing around Cyberpunk 2077 pre-release was too good. The marketing over-hyped the game too much. \n\nBut there's tons to love within the game. Here are a few things I had fun with: \n\n[list]\n    [*][b] Gunplay: [/b] The gunplay is super fun. By the end of the game, I had a crafted legendary handgun, fully upgraded. It completely demolished anything in my way. \n    [*][b] Driving: [/b] The driving is goofy, in a really fun way. Yeah, I was kinda all over the place at times, but I was having fun. Running over curbs and having my car bounce around never got old. \n    [*][b] Main Story: [/b] The main story is good. I didn't quite like the main story as the story arcs within side quests, but there was still bombastic moments that were really cool. \n    [*][b] Side Stories: [/b] The side missions are engaging and worth doing. Yes, the gigs can be a bit of a grind. But the side stories involving other characters were amazing. And all of the characters came to mean something to me. \n    [*][b] Upgrades: [/b] The upgrades, and the upgrade system, was neat. Some upgrades were more meaningful than others. There's a respec available, so it's easy to tune upgrades as you go. \n[/list]\n\nAgain, I had fun with the game, enjoying it for what it offered and not being bothered by what it didn't.",

        "content": "I went into this game knowing that it was going to be buggy, but my favorite game is skyrim so I'm not really one to judge. The game felt like they put all their effort into the first Act. Everything went smoothly (for the most part) If you pull jackie out of the car while hes getting into it the first time you get your vehicle he will remain at the food shop and still talk to you in the car. Character model is in passenger position while at the food stand. Anyway once I made it past Act 1 I thought it seemed hopeful but it went to crap very fast. I was immedietly flung what seemed like 100 meters from my position, No idea why. There was so much choppyness that you would have a better time looking at a someone streaming their game through discord. (without nitro) While in shops there is trash flying around from outside clipping into the walls from the inside and you see the same npc over and over again while on the move. Also During the first Act the game took away my sprint while not in a safe area and didnt give it back until i reloaded a WAY earlier save and restarted the game. Dont get me wrong the story is pretty kick ass but when your immersion is constantly broken by a standing still window stripper that looks like a carosel ride with a pole going through her the immersion goes away pretty fast. and often. Another thing that sucks is you cant use VIK the closest ripperdoc (cyber upgrades) to you until you pay off a 21000 dollar debt. Which is a shit ton for early game so you have to go to one far away in there hard to handle driving. When one of the top mods on nexus is a motorcycle and car handling mod you know that its pretty bad. Not terrible. But pretty bad. IF you want to play this game either wait for a sale or if someone gifts it to you or until the developers no man sky it. It feels like youre playing a beta while in free roam. Now I have a pretty nice computer around the 2500 dollar range and even with that It just felt bad. 2/10\n\n\n*Update \nGo watch Cyberpunk Edgrunners, then go to vortex and dowlnoad some QOL mods and its good. About as buggy as skyrim and I know youve bought that at least 2 times. bouta 6 out of ten now, just play it and have fun\\.",

Then the launch day came, I decided to give it a shot and what a good decision that was. Maybe it is because of my lack of hype, or just like making up my own mind about things but Cyberpunk 2077 is now one of my favorite games of all time.\n\nNever before could I get this invested in a singleplayer RPG's story, they usually lost me, it's a genre I could never really get into, but this game pulled me in and glued my eyes to the monitor until I knew how this story ended. The characters are phenomenal, the storytelling is excellent, I care about the characters in the game, I had to know how their story ends, how V's story ends. I enjoyed this game so much that by the end of 2020's December I had all the achievements unlocked. Now 222 hours later I finished my third playthrough, once on every lifepath and I loved it just as much as the first time, I explored other options in the game, other builds, story beats I haven't even seen before and even when I didn't intend to originally, I once again cleared out all the gigs, activities in Night City because I just had so much fun playing the game.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend the game to anyone looking for a great story, fun gunplay with interesting abilities and gadgets. System Requirements are steep but given just how next gen this game looks, I cannot fault them for that, at least even on the lowest presets you'll be looking at a game that looks better than some on the highest presets.",

        "content": "if you role play, this is how i might suggest the best experience. \n\n- pick your combat style and stick to it, in late game you can reset your skill tree at a modest price. try to commit to one main skill tree, and one secondary skill tree. it really does effect each play thru when you focus on your savant combat style and leave room for weaknesses. \n\n- decide motive for decisions, and remember it. It may change with time, but there is a story reason for you slowly becoming a maniac. A. right/wrong B. self-gain/fame C. friendship/clout. this is the three main decisions factors imo. Not ever decision is easy. own your character flaws. Night City Mercenary Life isn't for the faint of heart. Toughen up. Don't look back. Never apologize.\n \n- Throttle your own difficulty. Similar to Skyrim, you can cheat and grind systems to become something god tier. If you enjoy the number crunching route, don't be surprised if combat get's a bit easy, especially on the grind. The ai isn't super smart because it relies on you to be cool and stylish in your performance, and to pace yourself with the difficulty climb of the story.  So if you think about your role as a combatant, don't take it too strategically (3 tour veteran snipers). It's an RPG. your role is to look cool. Keep moving across the beautiful battlefields with style using all the tools you've equipped yourself with. If the combat gets light, switch to a weaker style. The game rewards you with tiers of experience even in dump stats. So when you take out all the gunmen, and all that is left is a knife boi, go toe to toe with him for those brawler mile-marker points to put into your main stats later. \n\n- your vehicles carry your stash in the trunk. took me way to long to realize this. save \"unique\" weapons and armor. They are one of a kind. These weapons can grow with you and be the best in the game if you are engineer. Otherwise collect them. Remember their stories.   \n\n- When you go into a new section of town and have some downtime, pay the local fixer a personal visit. Then stick around a while doing patrols in their neighborhood for them. Really spend some time in each section of town. immerse in the local culture.  \n\n- Try to keep your plot journal short as possible. There are a LOT of stories, and going randomly via proximity of a map marker can make those stories dilute. There is a lot of content. If you like story, try to stick to one mission at a time. Some missions have timers before the next event. use this to sleep at your apt. or go do some mercenary work for a fixer to earn street cred while you wait. Don't pick up too many quests at once so you can appreciate the plot beats. \n\n- people complain about driving. they should drive better! ;) the game has a lot of loading going on. burn rubber in the desert. In town, let off the gas a little. Enjoy the scenery and brake on your turns! lol. \n",

        "content": "[h1] In a Nutshell [/h1]\nCyberpunk 2077 isn't what I thought it would be, but I definitely enjoyed my time with it regardless. An open world action title with not much in the way of actual roleplaying, still suffering from dull AI, visual and gameplay bugs, and a remarkably short main quest. If you want a Cyberpunk RPG, you'll probably get more out of the two modern Deus Ex titles - but for at least 40 hours worth of enjoyment, give CP77 a chance.\n\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\nCyberpunk's writing ranges from good but melodramatic to really, really good. The plot is relatively tight and well paced, and the side quests are mostly of a very high quality. Visually, it's stunning - Night City's lights and sounds are well-realised, character models for most NPCs are brilliant, and the animations for weapons are top notch. \n\nVoice acting is pretty good overall, as is the music. Some of the radio tracks are great, particularly the SAMURAI songs on Morro Rock Radio by Refused. The score, with particular reference to the tracks \"V\" and \"The Rebel Path\", is great stuff. Combat music is intense and catchy, though you're likely to hear it far too much to keep it fresh. Reeves' performance as Johnny Silverhand initially annoyed me with the gruff voice and what felt like trying too hard to be angsty, but the more you interact with him, the more it falls away and his real character starts coming through. There's some genuinely great character moments in the game, with some thought-provoking bits about mortality, bioaugmentation and allowing corporations to run rampant.\n\n[h1] The Bad [/h1] \nGameplay wise, CP77 isn't really anything new. The mechanics are slightly varied and there is the option to spec a character to specialise in one area over another, but unless you're on Hard or Very Hard there isn't really much in the way of challenge. Car handling ranges from acceptable to borderline ridiculous - this isn't Forza, and it's not GTA IV. Cars have a tendency to spin wildly out of control if not handled properly, though CP77 doesn't have much in the way of chases or anything like that anyway. A lot of people seemed to think this would be a Cyberpunk GTA game, and it's not. It's more like a Cyberpunk Witcher, now that I think of it: Cyberpsycho hunts are essentially this game's version of Geralt's witcher contracts, for example. \n\n[h1] The Ugly [/h1]\nSeven months after release, the game is still a fair bit buggy. Nothing game breaking in my experience, but enough to cause frustration. Visual effects can break, DLSS can cause a ghosty, blurry mess on your screen, and ray tracing seems to have odd issues with car interiors. An awful (in my opinion) eye-adaptation effect to simulate leaving darkness and going into light can be disabled with mods, as can volumetric fog and bloom, since sometimes these effects can look pixelated and distracting. CDPR seem to have fixed the MAJOR issues, but tons of smaller ones remain - the same happened with Witcher 3, so I'm confident it'll be fixed in due time.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk is a good game, you just have to temper you expectations. It isn't a sandbox like GTA or RDR, it's an RPG through and through, just set in an open world.\n\nWhat this means is emergent gameplay is very limited. Like most RPGs, you have a fairly linear set of main quests to complete while there are a few meaty side quests. The rest is simply filler - go here, kill this enemy or go here steal something, you get the drift.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic if you have a high end rig. Night city is probably the most detailed open world ever made. This does help with immersiveness and helps offset the fact that the npc ai is non-existent. You can have a gunfight with some thugs and the cops a few meters away won't even react at all for example.\n\nThe game also still suffers from bugs and glitches. For example tech weapons sometimes refuse to fire when aiming down sights during combat, a very annoying bug.\n\nWith all these problems, why do I still recommend Cyberpunk? Because of the story and characters. The writing is great imo, and as you get to know the characters, they start to grow on you. The main questline explores the concept of transhumanism and also the price of revenge. It is the glue that keeps the game engrossing.\n\nIf you value narrative in games and can tolerate some bugs/glitches you will probably enjoy your time with this game. Those looking for the next GTA experience should look elsewhere.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 is a flawed but fantastic game. I didn't really hear about any of the hype surrounding the game until very late in development so my expectations were low but my excitement was high. Bought the game on launch, played about an hour, got bored, and then didn't touch it until April 2021.\nSince April and as of writing this review, I've beaten the game as two different characters, done every ending, beaten the secret ending 5 times, and gotten every achievement in the game. I've figured out how to clip outside the map, explored every part of the city twice over, and sunk way too much time into this game. I loved every second I played. The main story is incredible, and I've never had a story draw me in like this one has. The side missions are awesome, the worldbuilding is top notch, and the environment that Night City has is unmatched. Despite all this, there is a lot missing. I can break it up into two parts.\n\nPart 1. \nThe game lacks customization. Don't get me wrong, the character creation section is excessive, but after you've designed your \"V\", there isn't much customization for the rest of the game. \nPerks and abilities are a major part of the game, but when it comes to things like weapons, armor, clothing, housing, vehicles, there is very little customization. You cannot customize V's apartment, you can't pick the color of your car, you can't modify the way your weapons look (which I know isn't game breaking but it's a missed opportunity.) \nClothing really comes down to which item has the highest armor rating / other perks, because high level enemies punish you if you are trying to look unique instead of having armor. \nIn terms of customization, the game is lacking. An update that allows you to paint your car, or buy an expensive apartment adjacent the Peralezes would do a lot to change the immersion of the game.\n\nPart 2. \nDiverse Missions. Cyberpunk is action action action, basically at all times. Almost every mission is some derivative of a firefight. The game could use some diversity in its mission types. Gigs are fun, NCPD scanners are fun, and organized crime is fun, but it would be interesting to see where the game could go if there were non-violent gigs, or other avenues of income V could go down. The romance options are a great example of this. On my first playthrough, I got so invested in the Panam romance that I put the main story on the backburner to pursue the Aldecaldo quests. However, once you've finished the questline, there is basically nothing that happens afterwards. All the romances are like this. You get a few texts, maybe a call, and a gift or two, but that is it. Dates, further dialogue, round 2 in the bedroom, anything to make the relationships feel immersive rather than just an NPC. Because that is Cyberpunk's greatest strength and weakness. During a quest, the characters are written so well they almost feel like people, but once the spotlight is off them, the immersion breaks and you are reminded that they are NPCs.\n\nThose are my thoughts. I love the game, I've played too many hours already and I intend to play even more. Excited for the DLC. I highly recommend the game, even with the drawbacks.",

From the 2018 demo I was hyping myself up so badly that I literally took a WEEK off of work to pour myself into the game back in the December release. I was really hyped, that I even bought 2 metal displate (not a sponspor) posters and they're currently on my wall.\n\nThe game is good, really - For the first time ONLY.\nIt doesn't have much of replay-ability since the decisions you make usually end up in the same place. There are multiple endings, but the decisions you made a long the way make little matter up until the 'no return' quest.\n\nAfterwards, the game is quite shallow and doesn't have a lot of personality. There are certainly some quests which I will remember for quite a long time (like the Peralez quest and the guy who decided to be Jesus). Most of the game is not really rememberable and to be honest, I've forgotten most of it, unfortunately.\n\nSo take the game with a grain of salt. If you're a first time buyer I highly recommend to do EVERYTHING the game has to offer BEFORE getting to the no return point. Because doing it the second time is tiresome.\n\nGood thing that at least the landscape is pretty. :)",

        "content": "This game came in a little too late for, GOTY, in 2020 but it should be considered for 2021. Its an open world RPG with great shooting mechanics and a lot of story. Throw in a hint of Hentai and a lot of gore.  \nIf you like open world first person shooters you are going to like this. There is a lot of RPG elements if you choose to go that way. I suggest bumping it up to hard difficulty once you get a grasp for the game. This will make you consider your actions more when heading into battle. If you are having trouble with the shooting mechanics, just know, you can adjust everything to dial it in to your optimal specs. There is a couple ways to start the game but, as far as I can tell, there really isn't a difference.  Aside from some dialog choices, the story is pretty much the same. To complete most of the game it will take you over 60hrs. My first play through was pretty complete and came in around 75hrs.  I am playing through a 2nd time to unlock different upgrades in the skill tree. I would recommend upgrading things aside from weapons. You seem to be plenty powerful in that regard. I really love this game. Not a lot of things have turned my head recently, and this checked all my boxes. Don't sleep on it because of the BS surrounding Xbox One and PS4. If you have a good PC you are fine. It runs great and looks fantastic. Side quests are not to be ignored. I hope they give us a Multiplayer. The shooting mechanics are on par with any FPS.\n",

None of it came to production. I don't blame the devs. This is all on the management and corporate BS, but this is a true and real disappointment. I am writing this at a point where CDPR said they are satisfied with the stability of the game, and can concentrate on content. I'll believe it when I see it. We were told this would be a revolutionary game. I see GTA 3 with better graphics, and a different setting. Congrats, CDPR. You have achieved nothing but a city upgrade, and even that is terrible.",

A lot of bugs and very few patches after 7 months. Gameplay can feel super clunky and V's animations screw up sometimes like for example you fall from a higher place and V falls over but your camera doesnt do anything so you have no way of knowing if V is falling over. So you are stuck in place, standing still while being shot at and its awful. V's movement otherwise can feel unresponsive at times. Driving is pretty bad and vehicles are overly bouncy. No proper police even 7 months after. A lot of pop in and lag even when graphics are turned down. City is pretty dead when moving around somewhat quickly. Cant change characters looks or hairstyle or anything after starting the game atleast without mods... Player clothing is lackluster and doesnt get almost any clothing that the NPCs have without mods. Some perks, mods, upgrades etc are broken and do not work. Could go on and on lol. Still waiting for those QoL updates and free DLCs if theyre ever even coming",

I run it on a 5950X and a 3080 at highest (Non RTX / RayTraced) setting with no DLSS/upscaling and it's still great. The updates have smoothed out 99.8% of the bugs and it's been an enjoyable game to play. The scope of the world is massive and the attention to detail is unlike any other game I've ever played. It's slick and the story is pretty good. Don't believe the haters out there. If you have a decent system and have thought about trying it, do it.",

People were wanting Cyberpunk as quick as possible and got mad for the delays although everybody hyped the \"coming when it's ready announcement\" \n\nSure it has a few bugs, but honestly I've not had a single game-breaking one. It's less buggy than any Bethesda title currently and the devs said they'd work on it, now give them time to deliver before shitting your diapers and malding \n\n9/10 great story, fun gameplay, great acting, great graphics, a handful of bugs",

After 6 months it seems they have ironed out, or in some cases smoothed over, most of the major bugs and glitches on PC.  The biggest gripe I have so far is about enemies or cars popping-in at point blank range.  Overall though, if you are looking for an average game that suck away the hours, you'll be happy.  If you are expecting a revolutionary, genre defining masterpiece, then you are SOL and you will need to join a very large, very angry crowd.

Still early though as only played 40 Mins but hopefully the game will be improved for others as time goes by. So far so good. Hope it holds. At the moment, based on my experience, i recommend this game. My system is Windows 10 Pro, 32gb ddr4 ram at 3200mhz, Ryzen 2700x 8 Core cpu, Strix 1080 8gb graphics card. Hope this helps.",

There are awesome details through and through. Loved it. Genre is amazing, there's a lot to cover potentially if they want to pursue this title for a series or even huge DLCs, I'm all in.\n\nEdit: I think it is fair to add more content on this map for the next games. There are so many places in the city we are yet to discover. The map is massive and they can really add more content on top of this due to the density first person perspective provides and the multi layered nature of the map. The vertical room in the city can be utilized for expansions. \n\nI think this game is to be improved upon, there is little reason to recreate this city for future games, it can evolve, and scale vertically. We need more stories here, may or may not involve V, I really don't care. As long as we have night city as the main character you can just add anything you want in here and I will play.",

        "content": "[h1]Spoilerfree Review[/h1]\n\n[b]After ~7 Months (date of this review) people still seem to love/hate this game. If you see this game now during the summer sale and you are still unsure if you should buy it or not, let me help you to decide.[/b]\n\nThe game is heavy story focused and I will not say anything about the Story itself. Just let me tell you now: If you are a fan of games that have a big focus on the story. Get it! The story is brilliantly written and keeps you going until the very last minute! \n\nLet me split this review now a bit up to make this a bit more compact and easy to follow:\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\nIf you ever played Deus Ex, I don't need to describe it further. Not every Deus Ex tho! I am talking about Mankind Divided. Take that formula (Good and fun RPG elements, talent trees and with minor decision related choices) add some crafting. Voil\u00e0 - Cyberpunk 2077 \n\nBut if you didn't play Deus Ex (and you should) here a short summary:\n\nThe shooting mechanic (gunplay) is fun and you can try many builds. You choose how to approach a situation. You can go in with a bang or go complete silent with no casualties. In dialogues you will always get caught off by conversations that are engaging and will change the outcome. The crafting is kept simple and it is indeed optional, but having the ability to craft new gear is always a nice feature.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\nI don't really need to say anything about this one, but maybe infoarmations about the performance are nice?!\nI run this game on an \"Intel e3 1231 v3\" (equivalent ot an i7 4790) and a \"Nvidia 1060 6G\" while only having 8GB Ram. The settings on my side are a mix of medium and high and I can run it at 60 fps most of the time. In fights it can get down of course (too many explosions), but it really didn't kill the immersion for me. The latest patch even boosted the perforamnce so I might even can get higher now! \n\nAnother positive thing is that this game even looks really good on low settings as well. So if you are near the minimal requirements you will still have a stunning looking game!\n\n[b]Soundtrack:[/b]\nEargasm! Enough said!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5u1sOUlS6U\n\n[b]Atmosphere:[/b]\nYou know... Once in a while there is this really good idea to make a game that doesn't look as other games before. I am talking here about the aesthetics! This huge open world with its crowded streets and fucked up lore... This game feels like fresh air. It will get you caught off guard. This city breaths! It tells stories in every corner. If you didn't read anything about the world lore before (and you should) you will still get sucked into this world. It is even better as Deus Ex in these regards. You really have to trust me here! Also read every journal you find and try to learn how this \"Brave New World\" works. It is worth it! \n\n\n\nYou might encounter reviewers who say that there is nothing much to do there. But same people also compare this game to GTA.\n\n[b]Which brings me to my last point....[/b]\n\n[i]Stop comparing this game to GTA, Assassins Creed or others!\n\nMaybe compare it to Witcher 3 if you like. The open world is just there to give the player a playground. The real treasure is the story, the characters and all the sidequests. Every quest is different, every sidequest has its own story (some which are even connected) and every character you meet is interesting! There are not that many games who do the same, but always remember that Cyberpunk is not your average open world game![/i]\n\nSoooooo nothing negative?\nNo... this game is a journey! It is one of a kind and it is fun to play! It was maybe overhyped, but that is all!",

I remain confident that, eventually, it will be finished.  CDPR itself is finished if they don't, but how long that will take is anyone's guess.  If this disappoints you, slap yourself, lower your unrealistic  expectations.  Also, don't play this game on consoles.  Really, don't.  Settle only for the best, like me.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\n\n8/10\n\nIt is a fun game, even if it feels empty and unfinished at times.  What's here is enough to justify the pricetag, though if you suspect you might be disappointed, hold off for a sale.  Modders are doing their very best to patch the game and add content, so expect big things from them, as well.  Lots of sliders to adjust certain elements, like vehicle handling.  I highly suggest you tinker with vehicles, get as close to GTA5 as you can.  As for shooting and walking, movement is fluid, and gunplay is about what I expected.  Enemies toss grenades, flank, use cover etc.  Any veteran of FPSes and GTA will slide in quite well.\n\nSTORY:\n\n7/10\n\nIt's above average, but badly hurt by the early death of a very likeable character.  Johnny Silverhand feels shoehorned in, and V's ailment is a part of that.  Story is long enough, and convincing enough, but it's not something the average gamer will remember a year from now.\n\nVISUALS:\n\n8/10\n\nPerfectly fine for 2020, though glitches hit the rating.  I turned RayTracing off, because even my setup was chugging a little hard on max.\n\nSTABILITY:\n\n9/10\n\nThis is purely because of my rig.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME on anything less than a high end computer if you want a crash-free experience.  Consoles are a joke, so I won't press on this any further.\n\nOVERALL:\n\n7/10\n\nHeld back by incomplete state, glitches, and price compared to what we got.  Game will improve with time, but really should've held off on release.\n\nADDENDUM:\n\nLet this be a lesson to devs everywhere: DO NOT ANNOUNCE YOUR GAME UNTIL AFTER IT'S READY.  Dying Light 2 is a great example.  Dev process crapped itself, so it was (this is the important part) INDEFINITELY DELAYED.  Had CDPR just indefinitely delayed the game, sure, we wouldn't be playing it right now, but it would prevent the disaster that happened.  DEVS, DO NOT RELEASE UNFINISHED PRODUCTS!",

Played through all the endings including the secret one, done all the sidequests I can find and still, everytime I played it through I found several different outcomes of many of the quests and side/quests.\nOne of the best games I have ever played, and they did a great job giving life to Night City.\nIf you can get your hands on a raytracing graphics card and a screen that supports HDR (requires some tweaking to get it perfect), the graphics is probably the best I have ever seen in a game.",

I absolutely loved all of the story and the cast of characters you can play along side with, especially Johnny, Panam, and Kerry. Easily out of all the story based games I've ever played, this game is the best one by a long shot. Admittedly, I'm a sucker for anything cyberpunk style related. But this game just hit the sweet spot. So if you're looking for an action-packed, story-rich, and pure cyberpunk style eye-candy, this is it.",

        "content": "19Aug21 - just after v1.3 \"Major\" patch released\n\nSo I had decided to put the game down until the next patch came out - looking at the release notes, which I will not bore you with here, I decided that maybe I should create a new character (nomad!) to see what all the hubbub was about.\n\nUnfortunately, about a quarter second before my character reached out to open the hatch of their car to let Jackie put in the box..the game crashed with zero fanfare and in doing so, corrupting the game to the point where I had to delete it within windows instead of in-game, and create yet another new character. Very disappointing at v1.3 first impressions time.\n\nAfter a little over 480 hours in gameplay (without ever being able to complete the game), many many new character creations due to bugs, countless promises by CDPR, and all my hopes and dreams of a project with this potential being sliced up into small chunks and fed to the sharks, I have decided to uninstall this game and pray that I develop selective amnesia that this game ever existed.\n\nCDPR has had the time, almost a year now after releasing the game, to fix many glaring issues that the first two-to-three patches SHOULD fully resolve on AAA games. Yes, they have gone through trying times such as lawsuits, cyber breaches, employee defections, investor relations issues, and more - but all of these blockers are due to two things: 1. not releasing a quality product and 2. not following through on empty promises made to rectify the lack of a quality product at release.\n\nDoes it stem from bad leadership? I do not know and will not speculate.\n\nDoes it stem from a lack of technical industry knowledge and/or development skills? I do not believe so, looking at the pedigree of the initial project leads.\n\nIs it due to COVID? I believe that may have magnified whatever the root cause is, but I do not believe this is the culprit.\n\nThere is something systemically wrong during the production of this title, and the continued development lifecycle therein. No idea what it is, but because there was so much potential with this amazing combination of genre/content/venue, something has been lost in translation between vision and production.\n\n\nCDPR, I wish you Adieu in all things you do, but I will not be purchasing another game from you until lessons learned from this sad trainwreck are performed resolved and most importantly, not repeated in the future. While only one potential customer lost here, I hope you realize this is not only my opinion and the opinion of many others.\n\n\n\nOriginal review below - to add context on how bad some decisions really were and continue to be by CDPR, in my opinion.\n___________________________________________________________________\n\nDespite bad decisions by CDPR, and all the bad press - I still enjoy the game.\n\nI hope CDPR gives those of us who pre-ordered and stuck through it all some in-game swag items as a thank you for the support.\n\nI also wish they did not \"fix\" the component/money vending machine trick. By all appearances, it looked like it was by design the first time around, and allowed the players to maintain their immersion while making the money they desperately needed. If a player chose not to, they had the ability to NOT partake in the action, maintaining their personal level of immersion as well.\n\nThere are people who have problems playing games, physically speaking, and in-game tricks like that help them continue to play games in the first place without as much physical pain, Programming things in like this, giving the player the freedom to choose how much they wish to deviate from the developers' path, keeps the sandboxy feel as well as freedom of play, without breaking the game inherently. having money and basic components in this game doesn't destroy immersion at all.",

        "content": " For one of the most controversial games on launch, and with all the frustration everyone had for Cyberpunk 2077, the Playstation store even taking it out of its library, I enjoyed it a lot. I have almost 200 hours on the game and was sucked into the universe. From its interesting side missions, to The Relic main campaign. Losing a friend and making new ones, and even finding love. Even buying a couple joy toy shows. I really did enjoy my time playing Cyberpunk 2077.\n      Cyberpunk 2077 is a single player action role-playing game developed by CD Projekt Red. It sets you in Night City, year 2077, where you play as a character named \u201cV\u201d. You can pick from the three starts, Nomad, Street Kid, and Corpo. Each start is different and gives V a different background that will affect the game and gives you special options depending on what start you picked. You become a mercenary for hire, any job you can get it done. You would get these jobs from fixers and the more you do their jobs the more known you are in Night City, and more eddies you will get (Eddies is the currency in the game). \n      My experience was overall good, I chose to be a street kid. It starts you off in a bar with a broken nose, and you fix it. Then a fixer from upstairs has a job offer for you, he wants you to steal a very expensive vehicle from a parking lot nearby.  V takes the job offer and continues outside to go complete the job, but then V runs into El Padre, one of the 8 fixers you get jobs from, you tag on for a ride to your destination and we figure out that V came back from Atlanta recently and is starting over in Night City. El Padre continues to catch you up on things going on in Night City, you get stopped by 6th street gang members and they try to harass El Padre, but V comes in and stops them and they leave you alone. Then the car continues to drive and you reach your destination. Padre gives you his business card and you are on your way. You get to the Parking lot, find the vehicle, and are ready to leave with it, but of course something always goes wrong.\n      I got the game at launch and played it non stop after, and there were pros and cons. The pros were that the game was finally out and you can experience it, but the cons were the many bugs in the game. I didn\u2019t experience this a lot, but many said that their game would crash a lot. It was simply not ready for launch, it was for sure rushed and time was running out. So CD Projekt Red was ready for the backlash and hard criticism. The things that bothered me were some of the bugs that made you get stuck in areas or when a fixer called you and they wouldn\u2019t leave the screen or just not talk and stare at you. Another thing that frustrated me was the map itself. You can see certain parts of the map weren\u2019t completed and other parts of the map made it look like a roblox mini-game. I went through all of it tho, I still got immersed with the game, and some of the bugs just made the game funnier. \n      Overall I did complete everything that was offered in the game, it was a grind for sure. I am already starting a new save as a corpo and as female V to see what difference there is. It's already been 6 months since release and some of the main bugs are gone and there are fewer crashes. The game is playable, if you get mods for it, it makes it even more fun. If you are interested in buying Cyberpunk 2077 or on the fence and don\u2019t know what to decide, I highly recommend that you experience the game. It has a good amount of content and it satisfied me. Of course there is more coming to Cyberpunk 2077, so I am excited to see what's coming on the horizon.\n",

I liked the storyline, in terms of gameplay itself I find it hard to unite the DPS system in a shooter as well as putting stats on items, kind of limits your visual apperance. Some weird bugs and glitches here and there. The auto center for first person view in vehicles is pretty annoying.... performance is still a bit of an issue, however I am confident that this will become a gem over time! Pressure is allways required to do so right?",

You can tell that this game was rushed out and should have been delayed much longer to fix these bugs and problems that the game has. The story, voice acting, and characters all carry this game. I really hope they can fix this game with upcoming updates, its a damn shame it wasn't pushed back so all of the bugs could be fixed, but I still think that it's a fun game",

I installed it because I was bored and wanted to check it out and I ended up playing all day. Only ran into one bug (an elevator button didn't work) but I was able to quicksave and reload and it worked perfectly again. I have to say though, I will NEVER pre-order a game again because companies keep producing unfinished products. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO RELEASE UNFINISHED GAMES IF WE CONTINUE PRE-ORDERING. All that being said, I'm happy Cyberpunk's major problems have been fixed. ",

I am not even pissed about the bugs and glitches really, it's just so much was promised for literal years for this game and only about 1/3 of it made it in to the final product. This game is a TERRIBLE RPG.. As an action game, sure it's fun to shoot things and stuff but this was supposed to be the chosen one. Supposed to bring us the best open world mechanics and relationships and non-braindead NPCs who poof in and out of the world just by turning your back, ever. The story is not bad really, but your decisions in this game have 0.003% affect. They cut so much stuff that they said would be in this game it's really unreal.\n\nThis game will go down in history as the biggest scam game of all time. Tricked an entire world in to thinking that it was going to be the most immersive experience you've ever had, and ended up being a Fallout 76 type cash grab. I don't think I can ever forgive CDPR for this. They tricked us all because of how great Witcher 3 was and they knew it. I feel sorry for the actual devs of this game having to deal with their hard work stymied by corpo trash at the top.\"",

The fact is that this IS the best looking game on the market when you are talking about minimum graphics settings.\nDue to patch 1.22 the game is actually stable! (Although I have to reinstall after every update) The game runs at a stable and smooth 60FPS even on my GTX980, 16GBs of ram and i5-4460 (clocking in at 3.2Ghz although I can Overclock it to 4Ghz)\nEven with my somewhat outdated specs the game looks and runs brilliant with only minor frame drops that only happen once.\nAs someone who doesn't like 'DEEP IMMERSIVE STORYLINES' this game has a great story that can keep me (with the attention span of a fruit-fly) playing the game. Of course this is greatly enhanced by the gameplay.\nThe gameplay is brilliant, with the combat making sense (and of course being 'perfectly balanced' (:< ) and the side missions being short, but fun. The dialogue clearly has a lot of effort put into it by all of the voice actors, not at all sounding off in any way, in-fact immersing my fruit-fly brain into the game even more.\nOverall this is a great game, hell a modern classic even, although it has minor graphical and small physics/ vehicle spawning bugs, nothing breaks the game to the point that it is unplayable.\nThis game is a 9/10 from me.",

        "content": "This is definitely my favorite game right now--then again, it should be. it's pretty a marriage of my two favorite things, ghost in the shell and mr robot. That's not to say it doesnt feel original on its own, because it definitely does. The attention to detail is amazing, its clear cdpr really did care about what they were making, and its definitely sad it had to start out the way it did. now that things are largely fixed, my biggest criticism of this game, by far, is that it ends. but that (and this is where some spoilers will happen) is a very real criticism. the main story is amazing (i mean, i cried at times, but i cry very easily so), but it has a lot of urgency. its not the kind of thing you feel eager to put on hold. and thats a problem, because you cant play after the main quest, beyond time-warping back to before the final mission. thats especially annoying because, again, there was a lot put into this beyond the main story. just exploring a plausible future dystopia as deliberately detailed as this one is powerful in itself, not to mention many sidequests to embark on, relationships to forge, gigs to take part in. but feels weird putting off the main quest too much to do these things and in the context of the story it makes no sense to do them afterward. if I die, let me be johnny silverhand. if i upload my mind to the internet, let be upload it back into a puppet like ghost in the shell: innocence, if i join a  corpo again, let be get fired. That, aside from vehicle modification and linux ray tracing, is my biggest hope going forward. for now, having finished the main story, it feels weird returning, but i definitely enjoyed it and continue to impulsively google news of further updates, so.....recommended",

In the 446 hours of play I have not encountered a game breaking bug, so going off my own experience I can only judge the game on what is there. I wouldn't have put as many hours into it if I didn't love the game. Characters feel real, scenarios generally have many ways to tackle them, the city feels more alive than any other game I've played before, and the setting is amazing. Is the game too ambitious? Sure, they tried to get so much packed in and it's clear that they were not able to even get everything they wanted in it. Is the game bad because it didn't include everything, not by a long shot. Many people seem to think that this was a malicious attempt at raking in cash, if you know the devs and the previous games they have made it should be clear it is not. They were clearly hamstring by having to release the game on so many platforms that they would have needed much more time to ensure that it was working across the board. They should not have released this game on the PS4 and original Xbone, those systems were under powered for anything that was ever shown by the devs. That's the biggest mistake this game made, and frankly people just don't seem to take that into consideration or don't care and just wan't a good reason to be down on something with so much hype. I understand those that were upset due to bugs, but the hate goes way beyond what the game deserves.",

A fair summary would be: Games not finished, whats here is buggy yes but it has some great looking enviroments/world a decent enough story and ok action. Fairly average game at worst.\n\nNot a glowing review by any standard and certainly not what everyone was creaming themselves over with hype about.\n\nPeople who followed the game seem ott annoyed that some features that were mentioned being in the game were not, now as someone who avoids hype trains I didnt have this problem at all and frankly its rather off topic to reviewing the game itself, something like that is a problem with the developer/publisher/marketing team etc. it hasnt got any impact on what the quality of the game itself is, also as everyone points out its been in development for about a decade I think its safe to say that their inital plans for the game will have changed over that time.\n\nThere was no chance that this game could live up to the hype, it was always going to be an oof for some people, the bad luanch and the game being pretty underwelming made that effect much worse and people seem to have collectivly gone on some sort tyraid against the game. I'm no CDP Red kiss ass or something I just cant stand the OTT brain melt about the game, its no where near as bad as people are portraying it to be.\n\nAnyway the whole situation is just an example of how quick people are to go into insane collective group think about something that in reaility just mildly disapointing, its like it must be either full speed or full speed in reverse they just cant have a moderate response anymore lol. \n\nNormally I wouldnt bother to review a game I just thought was 'ok' but saying this is sub 70% is a joke and not a fair reflection of the product.\n\nEdit: Finally finished the game and I'd give it a 7/10 for what thats worth, worth the price and is an allround decent game. Some polish on some areas and a rather bland set of RPG mechanics are the only real downsides, I never had the bugs that made it so bad on launch and I'd say it is otherwise the same as it was then for everything else other than the bugs and performance issues. \n\nGood story, some very good moments and absolutely banging music, if you just bought into the anti-hype train post release then I'd strongly recommend giving it a chance as its easily worth your time.",

Every time I try to play it is painful to play. From the mechanics to NPC's this a shit game over all.

        "content": "[b]Edited/Updated Review:[/b]\n[i]TLDR: This game is awful.[/i]\n\n[b]The gameplay:[/b]\n- First of all, this game has the most basic bitch character creation I've seen in a while. Even Dark Souls or Skyrim do it better, barring the genitals which are 4 options total. Hell, if you mod Skyrim you have so many options you'd spend this entire game's playtime perfecting a preset to play that awful game with.\n- Secondly, this game is bog standard when it comes to action games (no it's not an RPG that's just background), it's just painfully mediocre at most things and average at best. The RPG elements are tacked on, the shoot n' loot mechanics add SOME variety but they're just re-feeding you barely interesting weapons, there's some fun in hacking and trying out stealth but the stealth only works when it feels like and the hacking quickly becomes overpowered to the point where an entire enemy area can be taken out by a single Contagion hack. \n- The rest of the combat is just your average shooting and meleeing from any FPS, melee combat is Skyrim to the core, with nothing to set it apart but upgrades that slow time when you dodge. Skyrim does that too though. Reason I mention it at all is because it's also an extremely bland experience, only mods make that game okay. The exploration and sandboxy stuff is there. Driving is a nightmare without mods though. There's enough to look at and run parkour about but there's nothing to do in the sandbox. You can't even start rampages like in GTA because the police is horribly inadequate and eventually 1shots you magically or gives up. It's sad.\n\n[b]The story:[/b]\n- What story? They had the entire world of Cyberpunk 2020, and 3.0 and they barely did anything with them except pepper you with lore every now and then. Johnny Silverhand is an unlikeable asshole and sure that's the point but it's also Keanu Reeves voicing him and he has the emotional range of plain white drywall. Having him in your head and having him comment on quests is easily the worst part of this game's story. His voice is obnoxious, he sounds like he's never swallowed spit his entire life before speaking and is constantly drowning in it, it's thick and viscous too like cigarette tar. \n- The \"romance\" options total in a number you can count with one hand, 4+1 fling that vanishes soon after it's over, and they're gender locked so it's 2 per, not that the characters are interesting at all besides Judy and Panam who were clearly written far more than River or the other one. Almost like they expected a certain demographic to bother before anyone else. I know for a fact the only character I wanted to romance was Takemura but can't have that. That'd be interesting. River ends up being a boring idiot, Panam stays sorta relevant though and Judy sticks out because someone actually bothered writing her.\n- While we're here, this game has the worst sex scenes I've ever seen in anything. Like seriously, I would consider Ride to Hell's scenes better, at least they're funny. It's fucking awkward in this, Skyrim's sex mods do even first person scenes better. I don't know who greenlit this, to such a limited scope too. There's 3 whole prostitutes and the 4 romance options to fuck with and every scene is just jumpcuts and weird angles and it makes you nauseous. I had to suffer through Keanu trying to act dom and I wrote this review directly after to vent out how fucking mad and disgusted I am.\n\n[b]Bugs/Glitches[/b]\n-It's still bad, we're over halfway through 2021 and this game is still barely playable. My original review of this was just complaining that I couldn't play it on my brand new 3070 with a 3700x CPU. I had to tinker for 2 weeks with the settings to get it playable and hooo boy don't even THINK about using RTX. It just won't work. At best with my settings right now I get 70-90FPS. 45 in places like the Japantown Neon Garden. It's nuts. CDPR says they're happy with this though so good enough I guess. Good job. There are times where I walk down a slope and instantly die, there's times where entire sections of map refuse to load and I gotta drive through a flickery seizure-inducing mess of terrain that was supposed to vanish for the actual road to load. I don't know how this happens after so much dev time and so much inhumane employee treatment but here we are. The real dystopia was inside us all along, bois.\n\n[b]Original Review:[/b]\nTried playing this on my brand spankin' new PC.\n40-50 fps no matter what the settings.\n\nI'm glad I got talked into buying this, now I know who to never listen to again for game advice.\nSuicide is less costly and less painful.\n\nHell, the pricetag on this could be used to buy hard drugs, streak through LA naked, and have a more enjoyable and consistent experience washed in just as much fake RTX neon.",

The Story is nice as well even though I think it can be a bit confusing at time, the Acting in this game is good as well. And the Graphics are awesome. (Played with everything on max) I can see what the game wanted to be, and what it could've been. In my Opinion this game is good and if you got a PC that is able to run RayTracing and the game on atleast Medium Settings 40+ Frames than I think you are good 2 go and explore Night City!",

        "content": "Though worthy of much criticism, any review that relegates this game as trash is greatly exaggerating.  Night City itself is nothing short of astonishing.  The detail on the cars is extremely impressive as well.  The story is gripping, and the characters deeply engaging.  Contrary to popular belief, the choices you make DO affect the game's outcome, though not to the extent we see in Witcher 3.  The combat AI is nothing to write home about, but it's not horrible.  The bugs are many and sundry, but it's gradually improving over time.  \n\nThe complaints you see in the reviews stem from the glaringly poor decision by CDPR's management to release the game before it was ready, and their desperate lies regarding its performance on legacy platforms.  Many players have allowed this to bias their take on the game itself, and understandably so.  \n\nIf you're not the type to let that affect your enjoyment of a game, then there should be nothing stopping you from playing now.  I personally find it enjoyable to tour and explore the city in all its splendor, immersing myself in the world and finding its many hidden secret places skipped by the missions.  If you're the same, I'd highly recommend the game.  Otherwise, I'd wait a year or so before playing it.",

I didn't watch any videos from the developers hyping up stuff, so I went in pretty blind just hoping for a Cyberpunk open world rpg. I  came away satisfied enough to recommend the game with the caveat you aren't going into this expecting GTA Cyberpunk, or \"the next generation of open world rpg\" in mind.\n\nI can totally understand how people can feel burned by this game. Its not a Cyberpunk GTA RPG (god that still sounds so cool....), its more of like \"Open World Diet Deus Ex\". As a fan of Fallout (1,  2, even 3, and especially New Vegas), I can definitely relate  what it feels like to being majorly let down after getting hyped for a game. I disliked Fallout 4, it felt like a post apocalyptic Far Cry to me more than a Fallout game. So I can totally get the vitriol sent this games way .\n\nI have wanted an open world cyberpunk game since GTA3 came out. I remember thinking, man a Blade Runner / Shadowrun GTA style game would be awesome. This game could have come so close, its hard not to feel somewhat like Obi Wan in Episode 3, \"you were the chosen one!\" when thinking about this game.\n\nI still had fun, but man what this could have been. I've never played a game where you can almost feel the cut content like  you can in this one, and that's really a shame. Hopefully its patched and fleshed out with dlc, if it has a turn around like No Mans Sky, or heck even Fallout 76 now, that would be great. \n\nI  want a good open world cyberpunk rpg. Nothing against Tolkien, or high fantasy, but I'm so..so...so sick of slaying dragons with swords and fireballs.... so I hope cdpr is able to polish this into a game they can be proud of. They have a history of improving their games post launch with their Witcher series so hopefully they are able to do the same here.",

The game is interesting and the arts great, but the combat should be improved on and there really isn't as much depth to the game as you would expect from all the hype.  This is an Adventure game.  There are many rpg elements in this game like building your character, collecting powerful loot, and interacting with the world around you.  There really isn't anything too special about this game comparing it to something like Skyrim, but the game does explore interesting ideas that makes it enjoyable and fun to play.  For example, you can do dope shit like getting a smart pistol that homes it's bullets onto enemies, or get enhance robotic panther legs that make your steps silent,  like in watchdogs you can hack the enviroment, you can get a built in grenade launcher into your character's arms, and there are many ways to deal with missions your own way.  Most actions you make in the game affect you in some way, and every mission is unique to the cyberpunk world.  Theres a lot of black mirror shit where the game brings up ideas of what a merc in this world would encounter.  Arts good, acting is good, story is decent, there are some bugs, but those are being hammered out.  Overall, like most games it good to play to enjoy something other than your real life.  \n\n\nBtw I know u probablly going to buy this for Keanu anyway lol",

I do play modded and as that does obviously add more to the game, the vanilla has a good story and quest lines that are easy to follow and have good content. The game looks great, but aside from the visuals and story telling, there really isn't much more. There is no customization as most of the vehicles and body appearance are set and stone as soon as the character creation is finished, and once you finish the game once, there is nothing that really comes at you that is \"new,\" as some of the perks you build into DO NOT work. You might find that one new weapon or play with a different weapon for this playthrough, but I feel all of the game play always leads to the same conclusion, no matter how you play.\n\nAll in all is good game. Graphics are fantastic, story telling is fantastic, replayablility is a little lacking and the bugs that make some options playthroughs end the same, are all apart of the great blunder that CDPR made, but it was a pretty good blunder imo.",

        "content": "To rip the bandaid off, this is a piece of garbage and not the game you or I waited 8 years for. \n\nTo call this game disappointing is an understatement. I won't chew your ear off about bugs, like everyone else seems content to do. No, rather I'm gonna chew your ear off about literally everything else under the mess. Even if CDPR patches out all the little bugs and critters it's still a boring slog of a hollow game that offers practically nothing interesting, unique, or even just ENJOYABLE. A turd is a turd, no matter how much you refine and polish it.\n\nWords cannot express how disappointing this game is, but I'll sure give it a try. First and foremost, I'd like to ask you something: Who was this game made for? What is it trying to accomplish? Where does the enjoyment come from? I'm gonna break down every aspect of this game and try to explain to you why it's such a dumpster fire. I'll even be nice to CDPR and pretend none of the marketing and lies exist. Just look at the game in a vacuum with an objective mindset.\n\nIs it a good RPG?\nShort answer: HAHAHAAHAHAHA NO\nLong answer: No. For starters, your lifepath selection hardly affects anything. You play through a different 20 minute long intro sequence at the start, which always culminates in the same montage of you and Jackie, and results in the same exact starting mission. V will always be a smart-mouthed \"cool dude\" street kid no matter what decisions you try to make. 98% of the dialog choices in the game have zero effect on the plot, world, or characters and it's just flavor text, and what lines do effect the plot basically boil down to \"how do you want to reach the same outcome?\". The endings aren't based at all on choices made throughout the game, you basically sit down right before the final mission and get to pick which ending you want. If you can make a save game 5 minutes before the end of the game and reload it to see every possible outcome, your \"RPG\" game is a POS. \n\nIs it a good FPS?\nShort answer: Not really.\nLong answer: The weapons are well-animated, sound great, and feel good to shoot, but the crummy half-baked RPG mechanics get in the way constantly. I despise the borderlands-esque way weapons are handled, and the stupid leveling nonsense of enemies. (Why does this assault rifle do less damage than this identical one? Why does this guy eat 500 shotgun shells to the face when the guy I dealt with 2 minutes ago instagibbed when I so much as thought about shooting him?) The enemy AI is also laughably braindead and easy regardless of difficulty. The \"hacking\" stuff feels like a tacked-on last minute addition because it's not balanced at all, you basically hold TAB and press the \"i win\" button whenever you see bad guys.\n\nIs it a good open-world/Sandbox game?\nShort answer: Not even close.\nLong answer: The phrase \"Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle\" gets passed around alot when talking about the world of Cyberjunk 2077, and I have to disagree....it's more like \"Wide as a puddle, deep as a puddle.\" Night City looks impressive in a screenshot, but it feels so bland and repetitive with nothing to do in it after only like 20 minutes of exploring. You can't interact with anything except the same copy-pasted vending machines, NPCs just stand staring at things or walking aimlessly, there's nothing particularly interesting or cool to find, side quests are Ubisoft levels of mind-numbingly repetitive \"go here, kill baddies\" etc. You can't even mess around with civilians like in a GTA game since their AI is so braindead stupid, oh yeah and they LITERALLY VANISH INTO THIN AIR IF THEY LEAVE YOUR VISION FOR EVEN A SINGLE FRAME. The police system is also hilariously awful, like seriously, 8 years and the best they could do was make them literally spawn directly behind you whenever a crime was committed? They couldn't even make them arrive by car, let alone chase the player? Utterly tragic. \n\nTo sum it up, everything about this game on a fundamental level is objectively flawed. Every news publication just drones on and on about bugs and bad performance on console, while they all seem happy to forget the game beneath the bugs is an absolute mess not even worth it if it was free. (It wastes your time.) CDPR went from one of my most loved publishers to easily my most hated, right up there with the likes of EA and Bethesda. Don't waste your time on this garbage. \n\nWhy can't anyone make a decent RPG anymore? *Sigh* well, back to playing Fallout: New Vegas for the 1 millionth time.\n\nEDIT: Patch 1.5 is a joke. 1 year and police AI still spawns out of thin air, player choices still don't matter, ending still is a total blueball that makes the whole game feel pointless, combat still sucks and feels unrewarding, etc. Oh but hey you can change your hair now. Yay! I'm just tired of this game and it feels like it sucked out a part of my soul by getting me so excited and dragging me along for a year. With how lackluster and utterly crap patch 1.5 is I feel like I can finally give up on this game, it will never be enjoyable no matter how long I give the devs to improve it. As the patch 1.5 trailer put it, \"you either love it or want to burn it.\" I say, let it burn.",

Night city looks and feels fantastic but Cdpr really need to add more interactivity and the ability for more roleplaying in the city. \nThanks to changes to the map it feels much more rewarding to explore. Not all Gigs are available from the start, and there is a reward from each fixer when you complete all gigs for them. Also side activities such as crime-in-progress are only shown on the map if you are near them so it feels much more natural and a lot less like busywork.\nA newly added transmog system for clothing is a excellent addition to the game.\n",

        "content": "While I haven't beaten Cyberpunk 2077 yet, currently I don't think I can recommend it to most people and I will update my review once I beat it, but currently...\n\nCyberpunk 2077 doesn't really do anything new, almost everything you will do in this game has been done in another game. There is nothing game changing about this game at all. Completely middle of the road and as ride as an ocean but as deep as a puddle. New Vegas is still my favourite RPG, Deus Ex is still the king of Cyberpunk media, and Witcher 3 is still the best CDPR game.\n\nI definitely cannot recommend this game to anyone has under a 20-Series card or similar, the performance on even my 3070 is pretty weak at times and my 1070 would flat out not run it ~30fps at all, and 30 series cards might as well be vaporware at this point. Playing it on low is also not really worth it, the gameplay itself is just very... basic and the story while pretty good I don't feel myself engaged much, the companion quests were way more interesting than the main quest, but the main quest was pretty fine from what I played, I know I'm at the final quest currently I just haven't actually started it. I've been telling myself I'm going to but I want to wait for the free content they're adding at some point, as I don't really see myself returning to the game after I beat it between lack of interest and just too much to go back and replay if I were going to, and from what I've gathered choosing your different paths in the intro doesnt really change much between playthroughs apart from some supplemental dialogue here and there and nothing game changing.\n\nI also can't stand the way this game handles its RPG mechanics, in your skill points give you very minor increases most of the time with stipulations to even using that increase and it turns itself into a looter shooter unless you are constantly upgrading your guns. Personally, I cannot STAND this way of handling weapons in games and would rather weapons with static stats more dependant on your skills than the Borderlands style of two visually similar guns where one just happens to have better stats for whatever reason.\n\nLike I said though, the game is gorgeous and the combat can be satisfying, especially playing it like a Street Samurai. If you do choose to pick it up, just don't expect anything deep or game changing. S'alright.\n\nEDIT: I finally did beat the game, and while it is satisfying the ending I chose (Don't Fear The Reaper, Johnny Version), I still don't think I can recommend CP2077. I do plan on doing more playthroughs now, though. I'm interested in what the Free DLC & Paid DLC will offer in the future.",

        "content": "This game was bought for me by a friend not long after launch, but long enough for some of the hotfixes to go through. I played it, enjoyed the atmosphere and the depth behind the side stories and I can look past the occasional UI bug, the goofy driving, etc. I grew up on Garry's Mod, Skyrim, and other games where glitches give a game character.\n\nI left the game then came back to it because it's a great game to play solo when my friends aren't online. Protip: The song Fortune Days (Virtual Boy Remix) (Feat. Virtual Boy) by The Glitch Mob goes great with most parts of the game. Very techy and futura. Anyways, I came back, did tons of side quests (because they're shockingly well fleshed out, and) because I was told to do them first before finishing the main story, and they were RIGHT. As many as you can reasonably stomach make the ending so much more meaningful. \n\nThe main job storyline hits you with a \"Point of No Return\" warning to let you know that, hey, after this it's main story til the end, so take care of business now. I really appreciated this, did a bunch of side jobs and grinding which helped out a ton. I went with a netrunner build, bolstered my quick hacks which are SUPER fun. I liken it to Skyrim's mage build.\n\nFinally, when it came to the ending I've been let down by a lot of games. Fallout 4, Skyrim even (a little), and others. Some are extremely well written, like Life Is Strange, which is my favorite game of all time for how well written the story is. Rather, it was.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 has, hands down, the best written story and the most mindblowing ending I have ever seen in a video game. And once you're done, it gives you certain (meaningfully) special items for completing the story, reloads you to a save before the ending so you can play in the open world more and (this is important) REGULARLY go back through the point of No Return and play out all of the ending scenarios with different levels of completion of the side stories without having to grind all the way through the main story again.\n\nAmazing game. I'd call it a must-play. If you can get past the bugs that in my opinion are marginal to begin with, it'll tell you a story that you'll never forget.",

Well driving motorcycles is so much more agile and tightly controllable then the cars that its a little silly but besides that",

Honestly, nothing more...\nThe game still feels like a choppy day one release and is lacking on every corner.\n\nIt's dark as fuck in certain areas and sadly, in the year 2077, flashlights or nightvision (behold..) aren't a thing anymore.\nAlmost half of the game revolves around BD's and shit, and every bum in the worst areas of the game cracks off to some BD. Yet, the MAIN character, who is supposed to be the utmost op guy by the end of the game, has \"incompatible hardware\" to use the Braindances you literally can buy on the streets.\nAlmost no choice is of any weight, driving is STILL more a chore than anything and the menu navigation is utter dog sh i t.\n\nAnd still, I had quite a little bit of fun in this broken mess... sadly the care this game recieved seems to fade, and it's still FAR from done.\n\nJust feels like a game that got aborted mid development. My review after 60 hours.",

If you heard of Cyberpunk you know of how many things are wrong with it, but if I am honest, I can look past it. The game itself fun from the gun play, to hacking, to so many other things. Do I recommend this, YES!!! Does the game still need heavy work done on it, also yes. If you can look past the bugs and high system requirement, try out this game. But if you want a more solid game that doesn't have so many bugs and smoother game play. Wait till this game has had a few more updates.",

        "content": "People actually sent CDPR death threats because they kept delaying, so I can't blame them for releasing  game before they felt like it was finished. \n\nThat being said, I didn't follow much of the lead up hype and bought this game shortly after launch. I played all the Witcher games, so I figured lets see how CDPR does cyber. I cant help but compare it to Witcher 3, their masterpiece which was comprised of interesting characters, amazing natural scenery, and architecture that blew away the mediocre medieval scenery that of even high budget cinema.\n\nPut simply, Cyberpunk 2077 has one big thing going for it: a ridiculously detailed open world that could have been just a game where you just walk around and look at stuff. Gameplay-wise it lifts aspects of other FPSes but is engrossing enough to keep you playing for hours. \n\nHowever as an \"RPG\" its hard to get to like your character or many other characters for that matter. None of the characters in this game are all that interesting except for one that dies off early in the game and another that is the rebellious country girl archetype.\n\nLike Witcher 3 the main story has its moments but as a whole is mediocre. Its the side missions and all the little encounters in between are what make it fun, funny, disheartening, and cathartic. If you get can around the fact that its called Cyberpunk but the story is not \"cyberpunk-genre\" conforming then its not an issue. Some condemn it for that, but I don't. Its the dystopian aftermath of an already dystopian cyberpunk world. A double dystopia. Dystopia-squared.\nSome heroic cyberpunks tried to fight the power and failed-- thus the culture of this world has become somewhat like that like the movie Idiocracy: base and loud. However unlike Idiocracy the world is tragic instead of funny and people are not lacking for intelligence. They live in a oppressively meaningless world but do the best that they can. Its American/Cosmopolitan society today cranked up to 11 including terrible food that only outsiders notice. Nihilism won. All that matters is cool guns, cool cars, outrageous cosmetics, cybernetic upgrades to your body, picturesque neon scenery, and as much money you can make to get more of it. The story is criticized for being shallow but for me that is the point. People didn't care enough to fix the world so now they pay for it by living a life of just trying to ease the pain of existence any way possible. That almost sounds like good science fiction.\n\nCore-gameplay-wise, I give it a C. Here are some bullet points to support that grade:\nThe crafting system is a flop. In the Witcher games you needed to find specific ingredients by different means for making epic gear instead of just finding generic parts.\nThe heart of the gameplay seems to be the FPS combat. The stealth/puzzle parts could have been shored up a little with gadgetry and skills.\nCharacter skill upgrades rarely make you feel satisfied in your choices.  \nBugs have been heavily fixed but driving anything but a motorcycle still sucks - a major shame because of the awesome looking cars/motorcycles it has. \nHacking is repetitive and low payoff for a \"cyber\" game.\nI would have loved an over-shoulder view option.Why spend all the money and time on the cool cyber cosmetics if you only see them occasionally?\nI have yet to come across an FPS with good melee combat, including this one.\nThe damn phone calls while you're in the middle of things. Apparently in the future the phones in everyones skull cant be set to mute while youre in the middle of a conversation or being shot at.\n\"Cyberspace\" could have been an option for non-FPS gameplay but instead its an interactive cutscene. \n\nI will still pop back into Witcher 3 after all these years and play it because its my happy place. I will spin up this game from time to time as well but not to play the missions or side quests. I hop on the motorcycle from Akira and drive from one end of the map to the other and get into random battles on the way. I'll hop out and walk around the city and find a new area the core gameplay never took you too/through. Its a cool world to visit but not to stay. For that reason I haven't uninstalled it yet.\n\nI still highly recommend this game despite the negatives. Its awesome just being in the city, looking around, seeing the sights, and I only played it at 1080p with a nearly 6 year old 1070GTX. \n\nDefinitely felt like there was something missing to the main story, but CDPR in the past has delivered with their Witcher 3 expansions, so we shall see if they add anything to this game. Enough people still seem to like Cyberpunk 2077 despite the bad press, lackluster story, and boilerplate gameplay. Including me. It could have been better but at least it wasn't ruined by impatient covid lockdown-crazed gamers who expected a Robinhood technofantasy. CDPR still delivered a viable escapism experience despite the hypocritical public pressure. Nice try, peasants. Despite your efforts to ruin it, CDPR still did it.",

Eventually, I too was sucked into the hype for a game we knew nothing about for years.\n\nWhen the game finally released in December of 2020, everyone was hoping this would finally be something good to come out of a terrible year. Well, let's just say it disappointed a lot of people. However, I am not here to tell you how terrible Cyberpunk is because I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. I want to focus on the good things about the game.\n\n[h1] Cyberpunk 2077 is a great RPG with a captivating story and setting, but it is certainly not revolutionary. [/h1]\n\nSome promised features - or anticipated ones - were not present in the final game, which is why I say this game is nothing groundbreaking. The feature I was most interested in was its [b] branching storyline [/b], which really wasn't as branching as you might think. For starters, when you create your character, you can choose one of three [b] Life Paths [/b] that sets your character's background; Nomad, Street Kid, or Corpo. These choices only affect how your character ties into the main story, but after the intro, you end up in the exact same place. You get some Life Path dialogue options, but nothing else is affected in any way. Also, the choices you make in dialogue scenes can change the direction of conversations you have with characters, but the overall story doesn't change all that much until the end. For certain characters, like Johnny Silverhand, your choices in dialogue may influence the relationship between you and them and they may speak to you with a different tone, but the narrative is largely unaffected.\n\nThat being said, and I may just be easy to please, I thoroughly enjoyed the story. I felt pretty immersed in Night City and it was a joy to take in the sites of massive skyscrapers overhead. The game made you feel small, like you really were in a gigantic city, even though the map size wasn't all that big compared to other open world titles. I never played the original TTRPG from the 80s, but I've read lore from classic Cyberpunk and it was cool to see those characters realized in a video game format. I was happy to hear that CDPR let the TTRPG's original creator, Mike Pondsmith, be very involved in creating the game and writing the story. CDPR has always been faithful to the source material for their games, like [i] The Witcher, [/i] and always include references for long-time fans to enjoy and reminisce on.\n\nThe gameplay felt pretty standard, but it was fun. This is another big example for \"good but not groundbreaking\" because there wasn't much in the way of new ideas or concepts. The most interesting part of the gameplay was the Hacking aspect, and I like how you can choose to build your character as a Netrunner and become as strong as someone who specs into a Solo build. Other than that, you have a decent system for core character Ability Scores, and a standard set of perks to choose from. My only issue with the perks is that some of them were flat out useless; if I remember correctly, there was a perk that increased either your stealth stat or damage while you were in water. The problem with that is the only water in the map is along the ocean, and there are rarely any combat encounters near water.\n\nThe driving in the game was also okay. It was a little rough around the edges, but since the initial release, CDPR has patches the driving gameplay to feel a lot smoother. As for the cars themselves, all of them have a very unique design that blends sci-fi elements with real cars, as well as hyper-detailed interiors that are really quite stunning. An especially unique car is [spoiler] Johnny SIlverhand's 1977 Porche. [/spoiler] One thing I had wished for, however, was car customization. The game gives you ownership of so many different vehicles by the end on top of many others available for purchase, but you're unable to customize any of them to feel more personalized. One of CDPR's selling points on vehicles before release was the emphasis on actually buying cars instead of stealing them, like in GTA, so I was expecting more incentive to actually buy them. I think I only bought two cars throughout my first playthough; one of them with the reason that I had to as per the game's tutorial, and the other because I needed something faster until I found an even faster car.\n\nThe last core gameplay mechanic I'll discuss is general exploration and quests. The map of Cyberpunk isn't as massive as other titles like [i] Breath of the Wild, [/i] but the world feels very lived in with all of its sidequests and activities. There wasn't a single quest or questline I felt unsatisfied upon completion; I think all of them had a really good story attached so that it didn't feel like monotonous grindy bullshit. This goes for questlines for main characters with romance options, like Judy, Panam, and River, but also for other quests you'd think are only worth doing for the money. While they do pay pretty well, you get to learn a lot about Night City and its inner workings, and explore concepts revolving around everyday life in the year 2077 and corporate corruption first-hand. There are plenty of collectible lore texts to read and learn about the world in addition, but it's really interesting to become involved in those concepts.\n\n[h1] Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is a very good game and I enjoyed playing it. [/h1]\n\nWhile I think the hype was dragged out for way too long, I think everyone in the gaming industry learned a valuable lesson. You cannot build that much anticipation for your games because it will only result in disappointment. Cyperpunk was obviously rushed and probably needed another year or two to be fleshed out, especially since there's an ungodly amount of bugs. Some of these bugs are game-breaking, but most of them are pretty funny to say the least. It's definitely worth playing, but don't go into it expecting to experience a revolutionary gaming experience.",

In my experience, most of the errors I encountered were related to the driving mechanics, or purely visual and had no effect on performance or mechanics.  So, with that out of the way:  It's good, but that's it.  It's not the revolutionary masterpiece everyone was hyping it up to be.  And that's fine.  What's here is rich in background lore, environmental storytelling, and very engrossing once you get deep in the paint.  \n\nI like just about everything that's on offer with Cyberpunk, but I'm just a little let down with it's... depth.  It's a little shallow at times.  Fine-tune the perk system, make some more of the interior environments, add some more side quests that aren't Gigs, you get the idea.  But what IS here is fantastic.  Quickhacking is fun, getting the upper tier Athletics skills and parkouring around is fun, and almost all of the side quests are interesting.  \n\nTL;DR Cyberpunk is good, it just needs to keep up with bugfixes and add a bit... more.",

The templates are very bad!\n\n-Water physics not available.\n\n-There are no planes or boats that you can drive.\n\n-Almost no underwater missions (only Judy's).\n\nBad NPCs or cops.\n\nCyberpunk has not earned its \"Triple A status\" so far. The main story is the only thing that deserves to be called \"Triple A\"! The developers should take these points to heart and improve/integrate/add to them. I hope the dlc's and updates will fix it.

Once i hit 53 hours the first big patch got added to the game, ever since the game is unplayable for me at 40 and under frames no matter what graphical setting I use.  I don't know what the hell they did and why it seemed to happen to only me and a few other people but it happened and its literally unplayable.

I gave up, i tried to refund it, but i got screwed since i already had the game longer than 2 weeks and a lot more hours than 2.  I would love a refund, i mean the game went from fine and playable to completely unplayable, i genuinely got robbed and cant get a refund i tried.  Seems like this is a pretty rare case, but if i were you I wouldn't risk it.

I suffered multiple crashes, functions not working, weird glitches, video going completing black when entering some areas, etc.\nNow after patches and updates: CP2017 - 1.22 most things work very well.  It's much faster, graphics work at the highest settings and just a few issues left that I managed to get through.  Overall I find it to be an enjoyable experience.\nThe game itself is a lot of fun, nice story, huge city to explore, great skill system that allows you to play any style you want (though some gigs may be more suited to one style over another).\nOverall, things have settled in nicely and I'm really looking to replay using a different style and get more DLC quests.\n",

        "content": "Oooooh Cyberpunk. I love and hate this game. CDPR really dropped the ball here, both in theme, genre and technical aspects of the game. Is it getting better? Kinda. But truth be told it's never going to be the RPG/Sim that it was hyped to be. I recommend the game because I enjoyed my 100+ hours with it, flaws and all. But that comes with a few caveats. \n\nDo you want an RPG? This ain't it, Chief. Cyberpunk is no more an RPG than FarCry is. You've just traded hunting resources to craft upgrades with, for XP and Money.\n\nDo you want real, world changing choices/consequences? Again- the story has some options/choices, but it sells the illusion of choice. There little if anything you do that actually changes the story, and you end up with a very \"Mass Effect\" type situation for the rap up. If you wanna really effect the world, this is the wrong game.\n\nDo you expect your game to function properly from start to finish? You might wanna give this a miss. Or at least wait until some of the DLC drops. Maybe by then they'll have the core of the game ironed out.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 is flawed, first of all. Some stuff doesn't work still, some stuff feels pretty janky even if it does work, and the game can feel incomplete. Many combinations of combat abilities are completely broken which can make more normal character choices feel super underpowered by comparison. Character choices don't feel meaningful enough - often it's just a throwaway dialogue option related to your skill choices that doesn't change the outcome of a quest at all. It's basically an Elder Scrolls game with even less polish, less overall content, and insane hardware requirements to run smoothly.\n\nIt has a lot going for it, however. If you like dystopian sci-fi, Night City is absolutely unmatched as a videogame setting. The world is absolutely incredible and some of the better-designed quests really draw you into it. The core storyline is really interesting and has a variety of endings based on your choices. Certain types of combat builds feel incredibly satisfying and if you're into feeling like a god against powerless enemies there are certainly builds that let you live that fantasy. It's also got very adult themes in a world where you're expecting them, rather than limiting itself to a PG-13 approach that would do a disservice to the setting.  Some of the characters like Judy, Panam, Rogue, Silverhand, and the Arasaka family get a masterful representation with incredible depth and development.\n\nIn another year of development this would have been a masterpiece and hopefully it gets that year post-release. The base game is good and the potential is incredible, especially for fans of first-person single player RPG's that also happen to love the Cyberpunk theme. If you're asking if you should buy and play through it the answer is yes if it ticks those boxes for you, and \"wait for it to be done\" if those aren't huge passions for you. They are for me and it's my favorite game, but in this unfinished state it may not be that for you and definitely is not that for everyone.",

Interesting, fleshed out, deep characters. There's humor - dark, mostly. It fits the game. The atmosphere. \nJust dive on in. \nExperience it for yourself. \n\nThere are MINOR bugs.

        "content": "Epic. Scope and scale of the city is way beyond anything ever attempted in a game before. This is not a game to rush through. Take your time and enjoy the sights. Now for the review.\n\n1. Ignore the people who have complained. There are no more bugs in this game than any other RPG. As for the frame rate; Fallout 4 and Red Dead Redemption 2 both had absolutely pitiful framerates in cities on PS4/Xbox (where the majority of the complaints are coming from), yet seemed to get a pass. I played this game on console first (PS5) and it was still very good. Follow any game close enough now a days and you will see a disturbing number of people who have complaints for every little thing. There's just no pleasing some folks.\n\n2. The FPS mechanics are average, but competent enough to make the game a lot of fun.\n\n3. The game can be played mainly as a stealth game if you so choose. Also can go for a hacking focused stealth route.\n\n4. The driving mechanics are fine, not great but not bad. Good variety in how different types of cars handle.\n\n5. The city is massive. Like nothing ever seen before in gaming.\n\n6. Story is fairly interesting.\n\n7. Tons of side content. Take your time and explore the city and this is a game that will last you easily 50 hours on your first play through.\n\n8. Ray tracing is not worth the frame rate hit. I have found that turning off screen space reflections also gives you another 10-15 frames and the difference is minimal. The game still looks great. DLSS balanced seems the best way to go to keep a crisp image while maintaining a great frame rate.\n\n9. There is one stretch of road in a specific part of the city where your frame rate will drop a good 30-40 frames. This only lasts for a few seconds and doesn't seem to happen anywhere else.\n\n10. Out in the badlands there is a stream of what I call ghost cars that look to be driving on the highway and then disappear. This is a very annoying bug, and the only one worthy of legitimate criticism in my opinion.\n\n\nThis game is not perfect. I think a lot of people were expecting perfection. It is, however, one of the best single player games of the last few years. I think that is more than enough.\n\n9/10\n\n",

It holds water. \n\nI felt like the story is good, the voice acting is incredible, the visuals are fantastic, and it held a huge amount of emotional resonance for me. I'm 3 play-throughs deep now, and my verdict is it's worth it - but I still would have preferred a 3rd person perspective, and think the Looter-shooter angle they went for with the guns and armor was dumber than a bag of hammers.. \n\nAnyway, to cap this off, I get why people were mad, especially console players - but for real, It's not as apocalyptically bad as some people might make you think. Not on PC anyway, and not after the patches we got over the last few weeks.\n\nTLDR: Not perfect (what is?), but worth the price of admission. Happy Gaming, folks.",

There are some good things about the game: the city is an impressive complex maze of streets and high rises, vehicle handling is much improved from the early release, and characters look realistic and expressive, but the best things are the story line and main character interactions. I'd say it's worth buying at half price and accepting it for what it's ended up being than for all the pre-release hype, as long as you don't mind downloading and installing installing mods (probably 4 or 5 are essential just to avoid being too irritated by bugs).",

        "content": "I bought this at release, but held back on playing it given all the bugs and bad reviews. Picked it up again after the 1.2 patch, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Pay no mind to the haters that criticize the game just because everyone else is - this is a good first person RPG with plenty of character customization options and lots do see and do. \n\nThe story is more linear than we were led to believe in their marketing, but still kept me interested and at the edge of my seat during many of the set pieces. My benchmark for RPG stories and worlds that stuck with me long after I finished the game include Witcher 3 and Mass Effect 1 - 3. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't at that level, but it is definitely right up there in the top 10 for great RPG stories. Also, those games were series that built up their characters and worlds over multiple games - perhaps future Cyberpunk titles will elevate the series,\n\nI did around 90 hours for a single play through and did all the major side quests and probably 80% of the smaller ones, called \"gigs.\" So its a lengthy game if you see all the sights. Speaking of which - I often found myself just stopping to admire the scenery - it is stunning. Rain swept nights in an industrial area, early morning god rays through dark, imposing skyscrapers, side streets with neon signs and gangsters spraying graffiti... Night City is beautiful if you have modern hardware. \n\nOn a game play note - the gunplay isn't that great initially, but as you level your character and get better gear then it becomes tighter. So be patient if it feels a bit janky in the beginning.",

It is well made and mostly I had no problem with it and I play it since it was launched.\nMy main problem with it is that the story gets in the way of enjoying the game. And the main story is not optional, like in many other games.\nMy other problem with the game is the philosophy of design adopted by the devs in which the main problem is not likely to be solved.\nAll in all, I would not tell you \"oh, I recommend you play this game\" as a blank statement.\nI would recommend you play this game if you are just looking for a over elaborated game for the amount of content it has.\nIn the past I thought the city that looked like it was a promise never fulfilled was an aesthetic choice. Now I think it was the game not having content to make the city as it should be before making the city as it is.\nAll in all, this game enjoys its \"popular niche status\" as the only game offering the kind of World it does, and therefore indulging in a public that would play something else, should that something else existed.\nNot everyone who likes this game enjoys fantasy or space environment to find better games in what this game lacks: Story content.",

Ultra settings with Ray Tracing on is an absolutely gorgeous experience. \nAs for the rest of the game: Impeccable. Dialogue is great, story line is extremely interesting and immersive IMO. The side missions are the same amazing quality like we got in The Witcher 3. Not a bunch of copy/paste garbage like you get with an Ubisoft title. They're original and as fun and rewarding as the main story line is.\nMelee combat is extremely satisfying, which was a concern for some from early game play videos. Gun play IMO is very smooth and there are a LOT of different guns in the game to suit different types of play styles.\nHacking is deeper and more fun than it is in Deus Ex or any other game I've personally played where hacking is a \"thing\".\nNot much more to say...CDPR absolutely nailed every aspect of this game and no one has captured the Cyberpunk genre the way they have.",

The Ai is brainless and the police system is just horrible, even the physics are bad, a 2004 game physics was better than this. The world is just dead. BUT the good thing about this game is the story and the characters. If you play it as a story game rather than an open world rpg game then you're gonna have one helluva time. But I did enjoy my time playing this game, and I even teared up in the endings I got. So imma recommend this to the people who just wants a good story.",

Still waiting for the game t be fixed and I hope in the future I can give a review, but I'm tired of defending games and developers that d gamer's dirty...(Anthem,Cyberpunk 2077, Outriders these games taught me something don't trust any game developer and wait a year before buying a game or at least DO NOT PREORDER watch and read several reviews about any all games before you buy!)\n \nIt is  up to us gamers to get these studios and developers in check...this crap is not acceptable...cut the fanboy crap out and  drill these guys to release games in a stable and playable states. I will never PREORDER or buy a game again until 6 months after release what a joke! (my angry truthful rant is over and have a nice day).",

Its not a deep RPG nor a GTA and yes driving is not fun.\nIf you keep your expectations normal, then you might have fun wandering the map getting used to the people, places, guns and mechanics of the Night City.\n\nI hope they dont release a Cyberpunk 2776.",

And its a damn shame with so much potential. replayability is hit or miss. on one side you forgot the events since you didnt really care, on the otherhand it just feels like a different way to dance along a linear story. your choices dont matter\n\ngame looks good, until you start seeing bugs, bad renders, and other issues. \n\ngameplay is alright, shooting feels good, good gun selection, melee is viable, stealth is fun, hacking is sweet, but it does get repetitive\n\nopen world is a ok start, but nothing like even older GTAs. police system is uninspired, npcs are bots, and its just feels empty. I rememeber reading a good qoute about this game either here or reddit or somewhere, where it was like\n'the game feels as vast as an ocean, but as deep as a puddle'. Worst part is we are 5 months in with no new content, and its about the same experience as launch. \n",

With that in mind, I do recommend this game. \n\nWhile I wasn't waiting for Cyberpunk nearly as long as other users, I do find the game enjoyable. I also want to point out that I did preorder the game, and I have played it since day one.  I'm not sure if it's because of my hardware, but I never had the bugs and issues that other users had. This game has always been playable, and has run smoothly for me. The only criticism I have is this is the one game I cannot run at 2160P. I have to run it at 1440P for it to run smoothly. That being said, it's not a hugely noticeable difference. \n\n I enjoy the story of the game. I'll be honest, I play this game like I played Skyrim, or Oblivion. I don't play it all the time, but when I do, it's an all day session. I love the story and the lore to this universe. While the game is not perfect, and does fall short of what may have been promised to users in the past, I still think it is a solid and enjoyable game. If you like story and lore, get this game. If not, it may not be the game for you.",

        "content": "Right. I've got 100 hours on record. I'm in a decent position to write an honest review, so here goes:\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, basically - depending, of course, upon your set-up.\n\n*Bugs*\nI'm on a 3080, 8700k set up, and it runs really well. 50-60fps with most things turned up to max (and DLSS of course). As far as bugs go, yeah it's got a few, but I haven't encountered anything that renders it unplayable. (Although hotfix 1.22 is causing some crashes.\n\n*Story*\nThis is where Cyberpunk shines - the story, while not necessarily groundbreaking, is cool. I liked it. I cared about the characters. V i s a bit of a vehicle for the other characters and the story, but everyone else is well written, and with the depth you'd expect from a CD Projekt game. Johnny Silverhand is cool - I loved his role. And Jackie. Ultimately, the story kept me going. It's 100% the game's strength (though don't expect ground-breaking Last of Us story-telling or anything like that. The sidequests vary, but there are some real, extended gems.\n\n*Gameplay*\nA mixed bag, to be honest. It's interesting to be able to build different characters - I've had a muscley shotgunning wielding maniac, a cyber ninja, a fast submachiner gunner, a computer freak assassin - it's nice and varied, and the variety of perks allow for quite custom made characters. One thing I did find was that the game was a bit easy. Word of advice: play it on at least hard mode. Driving is fine. Combat feels meaty, if a bit samey.\n\n*World* \nSadly, and surprisingly, this is where the game falls down. The world is big, bright, beautiful, but ultimately a bit dead, and a bit empty. The NPCs shatter the illusion you're living in a real world, just meandering about with no purpose - carbon-copied cardboard cutouts. Someone else wrote 'wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle' and while I don't think that's fair to say of the whole game, I think the world does feel like that. It doesn't feel like there's adventure round every corner like Witcher did. There's not enough to do around the world sadly, even if it does look great.\n\n*Overall*\n\nI do recommend this game. Yes, it is disappointing when considered alongside the hype, but that doesn't a bad game make. I think it's a solid 8/10, even if we were led to believe it would be an 11/10!",

I think I accidentally drove into a person one time and for THE REST of the game, the cops were on my tail: there was no option to bribe (in a city like Night City this seems like a pretty blatant oversight). Graphic design? Gorgeous. The environments didn't really change as the game went on. Shooting often felt weird and clunky, and going straight tank felt like the best option for bang for buck. AI didn't do much for me, nor did the exact same NPCs wandering back and forth. Skill trees came across as rushed or had lots of \"in-fill\" skills just to pad them out with something (hidden while underwater? uhh). I played again as another faction, thinking yeah okay, perhaps story-line differences between Nomads, Streetkids and Corpo will make it more interesting. The first 5 mins of the game is different, then wham-bam, it's the exact same. I thought with a game this big it would have great replay, but it doesn't. It felt like I had to grind a lot, and I was waiting for this big \"aha\" moment and it just felt like it never came. I got nothing from the game whatsoever, and now all the updates and hotfixes means it has a fatal error when I try to reopen, LOL.",

And now with the latest patches many were taken down. Anyway, enough with the bugs.\n\nIn terms of functionality, I was able to run it pretty smooth on an i-5 Coffee Lake, GTX 1080 Ti, 16 GB RAM, at 2560 x 1440 res. Did not stay all the time at 60 FPS, but TBH, I was too busy having fun to observe when there were drops. \n\nAnd finally... \n\nThe game is simply amazing! The storyline, the sci-fi futuristic atmosphere, music, character progression, voice acting, action, they all get an A+ from me. I rarely play a game twice once I've finished it, but in this case I went to two full playthroughs. I'll definitely replay it when one or more DLCs are released.",

        "content": "This was a game that I went into expecting some fun and engaging gameplay, but more importantly an epic and interesting story, and that's what I got.  Though the game did have some bugs and issues at launch (to say the least), in my experience they weren't enough to mar that experience (and I beat the entire game by early January before the big patches had really come into play).  With that intro out of the way here's what I found to be pros and cons of the game, and just for fun a few hilarious or annoying glitches I encountered when I first played it:\n\nPros:\n - The Story and Characters: God did they nail it in this department; while they didn't go as deep as I would have liked in some areas of the main story, the absolutely spectacular voice acting talent and writing on display in the characters more than made up for that.  \n - The World: Night city is beautiful, dilapidated, and mysterious all in equal measure, and I always found myself stumbling on something interesting even when re-visiting areas\n - The Side stories: While there were a few piddly little 'go to the place and shoot the man' quests, these were mostly optional and the more interesting side quests had a unique flair that made me want to play them all just so I could stumble on another gem.\n - The Gameplay: I played this game on a controller so I have no idea of the holds up for mouse and keyboard, but I found the controls and various gameplay options to be pretty smooth and intuitive, and that I had a lot of fun tinkering around with different styles.  I found the various styles also added a lot of room for replayability, e.g. a melee weapon build, a sniper, a hacker, some kind of stealth assassin, some combination of the above.\n\nCons:\n - No beating around the bush, the performance:  I first played this game on a 1080ti video card and was reliably getting around 40-ish FPS with settings between high and ultra, things have improved since then, but not much.  When this game came out it had a lot, and I mean a lot of glitchiness, some were funny, some were frustrating, and a few were near game breaking.  Save early, save often was my mantra on my first playthrough.  \n - Missed opportunities: This is a weird one, especially since I listed the story as a pro, but there were so many moments in the game where I felt they could have done so much more or gone so much deeper story wise, but didn't (likely due to a time crunch).  There are also side characters who give out side quests who sort of just show up and start giving you jobs, ostensibly because of your street cred, but on subsequent playthroughs I found in some of the background openers you actually meet these characters so it just felt weird to me.\n - First person melee combat: hope you don't have motion sickness, I don't but it still got to me at times...its also super easy to lose enemies if you're attacking fast and dodging up close and in first person.\n\nFunny Glitches:\n - All of the Trees on the ground being completely visible through floor of the air car in the Corpo opening sequence\n - A random serious cutscene where Jackie's pistol glitched into his head and was sticking out of his ear\n - A non-leathal stealth mission where I knocked out a guard to loot a key, then he exploded when I opened his inventory\n - Cars being summoned underneath other cars and sending both vehicles skyrocketing into the air\n - Using leg cybermods to jump high, only to get lodged in a buildings architecture and rocketed backward at something like the land speed record\n - Having bosses getting stuck on a tiny box or just standing there aggressively shouting at me while taking no action to attack me\n\nOverall I seriously enjoyed this game despite its none to insignificant flaws, and I'm very much looking forward to the addition of the new DLC being rumored around.  Between that and all the work that's already been done patching the game CDPR does seem to have their hearts set on building this game into something truly epic.  The game is already head and shoulders above most AAA games, so I feel comfortable recommending it even in its current state, and hope to see it grow and improve even further.\n\n",

I was able complete the main story line and do about 80 percent of the side missions without any major issues. The game still has lot of minor bugs and there are still a lot of grammar issues when I read through the missions; still this game is very enjoyable and the main and side mission story lines are great. Is worth $59.95? No!  I paid $47.99 for the game I think this is still pricey for an unpolished game.  Since they have sold over 13 million copies of this game I guess this is the way of the future, release a crappy product and let the public find the bugs and still make a nice piece of change.",

Still fun with hella potential? YES. 1.2 is SO MUCH better and less buggier, IDC what anyone else says. I'm rocking a Gigabyte 2070 Super OC that hits 2GHz, 3800x hittin 4.4GHz (undervolted and OC'd), 32G 3600 Ram, m.2/NVMe SSD... Not the top of the line, but not bad either. I'm having a wonderful time though. I only use RTX lighting (Ultra) and shadows. Everything else basically high-ultra. DLSS quality and rarely get dips under 60fps, driving or on foot/in battle.\n\nAmazing game mostly, amazing story, immersion, customization, (So far, needs work/additions.) beautiful graphics, improved and downright fun (Most times.) (Again, needs work.) battle system, etc.\n\nThis is 1,000% a game that if released in Dec/2021 instead of 2020, would've been the true GOTY and then some, expected-minimal cut content included. That doesn't mean all of these \"Free DLC's\" We're about to get (AKA \"CUT CONTENT\").\n\nI'm talking, if they had all of what we're going to be updated with for the rest of the year all ready to go at launch, with the expected minimal-no bugs and ACTUAL, UNIQUE DLC, then I'd give it 5 stars.\n\nI sure as **** give it 4 stars though because I'm having so much damn fun still!!! Hahaha.\n\nI recommend using a trainer for a few light things, not god mode. HIGHLY recommend you explore with Inf. Double jump!! :)\n\nWould I recommend you to buy this full price AFTER 1.2? If you have a capable PC, I say YES. IF you are rocking 10 year old tech or a PS4/XB ONE? Give it another year, upgrade and an enjoy the game (mostly) as intended.\n\nHave fun \"Chooms\" and remember, if you have an AMD CPU over 6 cores, enable the SMT fix! I get SUPERCHARGED performance with my Ryzen 7 3800x now. All 16 threads firing off nicely from 30-40% to 80-90% utilization! I can ALWAYS notice the FPS improvement with \"high\" crowd settings!\n\nSee you in Night City motha*****s",

But in terms of playing the game I enjoyed the story and found the side quests to be very engaging and at times even more so than the actual main story the game allows you to get close to the characters and after I completed the main story (I selected one of the \"bad\" endings) I was left with a feeling I can't quite explane but it's unique to anything any other game has done before and it engaged me to keep playing after and try out the different sorries and different backgrounds which is where I found the game to be less than I expected since the background you chose only changes your starting mission and gives you some background unique dialogue which doesn't seem to give you different outcomes for your conversations. But this is the only bad things I have to say about the game since I loved everything else about the game and I can not wait for CDPR to release the DLC's for this game.",

        "content": "CDPR has released a banger of a game with Cyberpunk 2077, though you may not know it initially. The game has gone down in infamy as what happens when you preorder an unfinished product. But I don't hold that against CPDR. This is the game that made me decide to upgrade from a GTX 970 to an RTX 3070, because I wanted to experience Night City in its full unabashed glory. Unfortunately things didn't go as planned, with launch..But do I regret my decision? Do I feel embarrassed for falling into the hype? No, I don't. And you shouldn't either.\n\nUnderneath all the jankiness, performance issues, and bugs is one of my most favorite video game settings to this day, with some compelling gunplay to boot. The gameplay itself isn't revolutionary or groundbreaking.. But I love it, regardless. Still, I decided to wait.. I decided to put this game aside, and refrain from judging it until it was more...Polished. \n\nIt's now a year later, and CDPR has done a tremendous job patching the game and bringing it up to snuff. I recently returned to it, starting a new save game and everything. And I'm glad I waited. Because I liked Cyberpunk 2077 from the beginning. But now that I can truly experience it? I love it. The atmosphere, the vehicles, the beefy gunplay, the provocative story that seems to thin the line between life and death, and how you define what it is to be..You.\n\nI can only hope Cyberpunk 2077 outgrows the reputation it gained at its launch, and that people find something to fall inlove with, in the same way that I did. And I'm hoping that CDPR continues to support it, and adds the quality content that we know they're capable of. The last thing any of us want is for them to feel put off because of this games rocky start.",

On older hardware you need to lower the settings of course and a fast SSD is a must. \n\nForget this game on old consoles, I doubt it will ever run well on a PS4 and it is fully understandable that people are pissed at that since CDPR sold it as such. Even if it can run they will have to scale down the detail way to much and Night City won't be the same. So if you need it for console then wait for a proper next-gen version (PS5 optimized etc).\n\nStill hoping CDPR will add some of the stuff they showed in the previews but the game is not bad for what it is now. Also, the fact that you can't change your characters apparance at all once started is really stupid. It's Cyberpunk, let me at least change the hair! \n\nThank god for Mods!!",

Is it fixed? Does it hold up to the expectations we had of it?\n\nShort answer: Yes, No, No.\n\nIt is substantially better than it was, with multiple content additions, performance increases and bug fixes implemented that make it a far more functional title. But its still really not 100% of what it should be. Bugs are still very rampant, performance is still only okay, and there's been no overhaul that fixes the jank the game has.\nIf you've been interested in trying the game, I'd absolutely say now is a fine time to, but if you were holding out for a true 1.0 feeling, this still isn't it.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nI know this is always gonna be a controversial upvote, because at the end of the day the game does deserve its reputation of being a buggy mess with a huge amount of neglected features (honestly, almost every single part of the game feels like they planned on being able to spend another year on it, even if it had no bugs) I will have to admit that the 100 or so hours I played the game were actually quite satisfying all the way up to the end.\nAnd while I can't really say if I'll ever play the game again, I am sad to see it go and I'm glad to have had the chance to play it.\n\nA Solid What-A-Shame-It-Wasnt-Better/10",

The story is amazing, Night City is beautiful, gameplay is fun, you can approach quests in many different ways, replayability and open world is better than in W3 (there you can play sword & alchemy or sword & signs, here you can play melee, focus on various guns, be a netrunner, play stealthy etc.) Also endings for me are more varied here, they are just easier to pick.\n\nSo far I played it twice (2.5 in fact, I started 2nd playthrough in Dec and stopped after a while, I wanted this experience to remain fresh), first one was short 50h mostly with shotgun and focus on main story, now I had almost complete walkthrough of over 100h as a netrunner. And for sure I will play again, probably after these free dlc are released. So for me it's not a question if it's worth buying, only when and for what price. If you are rpg fun and expect to play more than once, buy it now, if you expect one playthrough - wait for complete experience.\n\nCouple of words about flaws. I have a good pc so nothing gamebreaking, but in Dec there was a lot of bugs, mostly visual but I also had to restart 2 or 3 side quests. Now almost nothing, couple of floating objects, couple of cars driving though NPCs or walls and that's all during 100h. Yes, you can feel that the game is rushed, it's not polished like W3, you can see cut content from time to time and it's annoying. Nonetheless, it's still a \"must play\" in my view. As I said earlier - the only question is when.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077. No charisma, but impressive cocks.\n\nIf I was to describe the game with one word, I\u2019d use \u2018\u2019Janky\u2019\u2019, as my best friend himself described Cyberpunk, the same person that introduced the game to me.\n\nI personally run the game with an RTX 2060, with DLSS capabilities, therefore I did not encounter any performance issues nor bugs. However I do not doubt the existence of issues, as the majority has reported.\n\nI do believe however that everything can be fixed\u2026eventually.\nQuestion is; Will it be fixed?\n\nThe core of the game, the massive open world is incredibly superficial, with basically nothing to do in it.\nCDPR has exceeded my expectations, and crafted a beautiful, detailed world. Yet it\u2019s being bottlenecked by the low functioning AI and overly simplistic gameplay.\n\nRoleplaying elements in a cyberpunk 2077\u2019s dystopia do absolutely nothing to reach the roleplaying capability of Deus Ex.\nThere are no extracurricular activities that don\u2019t involve shooting ads, like Red Dead Redemption 2 provides, a flagship of gaming\u2019s potential, in my firm belief. (a game that released 2 years before cyberpunk, 8 years in development)\nThere is no tight gunplay, as you would find in the first Watch_Dogs, a game characterised by its John Wick style of fighting (before John Wick was even a thing) (a game that released 6 years before cyberpunk,  5 years in development)\n\nRDR2 is used as an example, since it is the exemplar of modern open world gaming, which CDPR had set out to surpass and revolutionise open world gaming.\nWatch_Dogs is used as an example, as it is an open world shooter with cyberpunk elements.\n\n8 years of hype and development, to launch what one would describe as an early access game. Lacking elements, games way before its era, included and even perfected.\n\nThe AI lacks any sort of intelligence. Enemies rush at V without any sense of self preservation.\nOften-times standing idly allowing V to strike them.\nThe police force, even after patch 1.2, insists on spawning behind the player, and directly in front of him in certain situations. Police chases are not available unfortunately, as they would prove a\nre-playability factor, and a fascinating experience for the player as dynamism of the AI is put to the max in order to stop them, which can lead into numerous intriguing outcomes and last for countless hours.\nInstead the enemy and police AI both must have listened to the Caretaker\u2019s Everywhere At The End of Time as they will immediately forget who V is the moment he/she walks away. The world doesn\u2019t interact with you as there is no bounty or police search mechanic. The gunfight can be restarted by simply walking up to a combatant and letting them stare at you for 3 seconds.\n\nApproach methods include guns blazing and quickhacking or a combination of those.\nGuns blazing can prove a rather fascinating experience given the arsenal and cyberware that are available to V, although one should not expect tactical combat like in Red Dead or an adrenaline infused shootout like in watch dogs, due to the AI not being dynamic and adaptive.\nQuickhacking your way into your objective can be quite intriguing, since there is a multitude of quickhacks to mess your enemy with or their equipment. Unlike Watch_Dogs however, hacking in Cyberpunk is limited to pointing your crosshairs into an object and browsing a trainer menu. Even time slows while V is in netrunning mode. This mechanic renders combat boring as the player will not be put in  immediate danger, forcing them to alter their tactics.\nStealth is decent, despite random bugged situations where enemies can spot V behind cover.\n\nThe story is engaging yet its majority forgettable. It is a cyberpunk setting\u2026 but only in appearances. There is constant talk of megacorporations assuming control of the world, yet only one corporation takes the stage. There is no political intrigue, no conspiracy theories that turn out to be true, mo investigating into the greater mystery of the corpo world. Keanu Reeves, breathtaking as he is, takes V\u2019s breath away and we must find a way to stop it. \n\nV\u2019s backstory is utterly irrelevant. A 20 minute prologue, followed by a Dallas Buyers montage and boom you\u2019re now a street kid congratulations. Why is V in Night City? Why do we want to be a living legends? What are V\u2019s motives? Such questions could have been answered by adding a couple of hours to the game, where world building and character development would be included.\n\nThe characters definitely carry the narrative, with Johnny\u2019s personal vendetta and Takemura\u2019s strong honor code.\n\nRegardless, I did in fact enjoy the game and was fascinated by its storytelling, especially the ending. \nMusic is simply fantastic (OST, environmental and Samurai)\nThe voice acting and animations are exceptional.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping that CDPR will not let such potential go to waste and the playerbase will not be forced to blow up their headquarters.\n\nAfter all\u2026It would be a shame for a thing of beauty to fade away.",

        "content": "10/10\nReally amazing game. The whole story was absolutelly stunning, I couldn't get myself off it, until I completed literally everything which can be done in the game. After playing all of the ends, I literally felt empty. Haven't got this feeling for a loong time after completing a game.. The graphics is awesome and gameplay is pretty good. Never experienced a single game-breaking bug. The game has some big downs tho.. For example the police mechanics are trully terrible, the linearity of the story is a big disappointment, there is lack of any customization once in the game, and i could go on.. They should have waited at least a year or two and develop the game the way properly, but overall it's still great game and i don't think it deserves the hate.\n\nEDIT: So I have played and finished the game (not completely all quests like first time) again after something like year after release on a better pc and there is no doubt that in my eyes this is one of the best games ever created. The atmosphere, the story, the soundtrack, it all just beats the occasional bugs (name an rpg-action game that  doesn\u00b4t have that) or some unfinished (or \"promised\" and not actually implemented) parts.. On the second playtrough I realised that I just understand johny much more than I though on the first pt and when i figured out how to get 100% relationship with him that just got me...\n\nSpeaking in numbers:\nGameplay 8.5/10 | Story 11/10 | Atmosphere 10/10 | Soundtrack 12/10\n\nAt the end, I actually love the game at the state it has been released",

        "content": "TLDR: People got hyped and blindsighted, scummy yes, but not a reason to bash a very good game. What you get is still fun, you'll enjoy it.\n\n\nBro, I'll be honest right. I get that a lot of people were sucked into this for a very long while, people went crazy over the promises and went nuts over what was on paper. And better yet it was a well known developer that could have pulled it off, due their reputation. And I completely understand how people feel fucked for believing it. However even with that said, I cannot possibly give this game a bad review.\n\nIf you're still on the fence of where you should buy the game, then listen here.\nI don't think the stuff that was promised will be all implemented. Maybe some good stuff will eventually with their DLC plans and whatnot, but right now, what you pay for, is still a great game. Call me whatever you want, but I didn't get hyped for this game, I thought it was a good idea when I heard about it ,but I didn't lose my shit, I tempered my expectations. Perhaps you could say that the fact that I tempered my expectations alone is a bad sign to show where the gaming industry is, where the moment you see a game that seems promise so much, you already know that a lot of the stuff being promised won't be in the final product. But in the end that's how it is, and unfortunately it's not the first time it's happened. Do I think that's bad? Yes. Do I think the work people have put into this should be disregarded and that what's on offer already isn't worth the price of admission? No, and here's why.\n\nThis game's content, story, visuals, and themes are all, without a doubt, great. I have played many games, and many RPG's, and this is one of the games that I can see myself coming back to to experience it. The city's design alone is fantastic, these guys nailed the cyberpunk aesthetic to a tee and that is worth a lot. The story is also the essence of what being a punk is, wether you accept it or not, and while a lot of people dislike the ending, I for one think it's only fitting for it to end on a note like that. The only problem that I genuinely have with the story, is the pacing device used. The fact that the game constantly reminds you that you have to work as fast as you can to save yourself damages the ability for someone to justify to themselves going out looking for side quests (Which are quite good) on their first run of the game. It constantly left me with a guilty feeling that I should be constantly on the move to find a way to fix the problem. However, it's just an illusion. A very well built illusion, but nothing more than that.\n\nNow, let's talk about the bugs! Oh the horror! I know you've seen all these terrible, horrendous bugs and glitches everywhere! Model LOD's not loading in properly! Cars jettisoning into space at mach 20 speeds! Oh my lord however could we recover!\nHonestly, during my 65 hours of game i've had so far, i've never encountered any of these game breaking bugs. And odds are you won't find them just regularly playing it. What I've found were simple bugs that I'd expect from any new release of an open world game nowadays, small stuff that doesn't impede your progress, or will ruin your game. I have a feeling some of these bugs are being blown out of proportion. Not because they don't happen, they very well could, there's videos for that after all! However when you go online and all you see are these videos showing off all the bugs and problems people find, it's not going to give you an honest representation of the game.\n\nNow, before you go and call me a CDPR shill, this is the only game i've ever played from CDPR. And I do have my own problems with the game, but I don't fill they are enough to not warrant a recommendation. Weapon variety is small, you'll find the same model of the same few weapons with a different paint job that somehow shoot harder. Am I saying every gun in game should have their own model? No, I just would have liked to see more weapon designs. Some side quests aren't super interesting, and some side characters seem to be uniquely designed, yet get only used once. And of course, some of the bugs drag down and can break the immersion some times, but like I said, they're nothing you haven't seen before.\n\nAll in all the game isn't bad. It's quite good actually with all things considered. It'll give you plenty of enjoyment and with the new planned content, yeah, I can see this becoming more fun. The game was rushed to release due to stupid corporate reasoning and that's well documented, but that isn't an excuse to not review something honestly and give it it's due. While the PC version is fine, ps4 still got shafted hard with it's terrible performance. and last gen consoles aren't doing so good with the game in general, but that's neither here nor there, given we're talking about the PC version of the game.\n\nMy final words: It's a good game, it's not an amazing, revolutionary game, but it's a good game, it has it's problems, but every game does. If you look past that, you'll enjoy the experience, and it'll be worth your time and money.\n",

Nobody here is idiot enough to think ALL GAMES MUST AND WILL be delivered in a perfect shape, if that would be even near the truth, people could never take their money back from Steam, which, by the way, it's a failed system, most kids just refund their games ONLY because they didn't like them.\n\nCDPR is doing its job, just like Blizzard always did: World of Warcraft had a lot of bugs by the launch, i know cause i was there, the game was never perfect, it's not even close nowadays, but they keep working, they keep patching weekly, that's how a big game is kept up and know what? Many people are still actually PAYING monthly to keep playing, if that's not quality, i don't know what else is.\nI really doubt the following: IF Cyberpunk were sold for U$10,00~U$30,00, many of those dislikers would really think/act differently.\nYou came to check if you should BUY this game?

There's honestly very little to the game.  There are so many other games that do more, cost less, and will run better.\n\nEvery mechanic that's actually in the game is ultimately disappointing.  From driving, combat, hacking, stealth, you name it it's underwhelming.  The story is OK.  However since you can do many things in any order some story elements start to not make sense  especially things around Johnny and considering how critical he is to the story it drags it down.\n\nEvery area is honestly super empty.  Visually, if you don't look closely, it might seem like a busy city.  But then you see the same NPC or car 3,4,5 times in a row.  NPCs not actually doing anything.  They finally patched in some rudimentary AI but it still doesn't change the fact if you just look around you see all the buildings as flat facades and the NPCs as just empty shells.  Most other games find ways to work around this, to make a city feel alive.  This game is barren.\n\nIt will take several content updates, including expansion packs/DLC to make the game complete.  To make it the game that was promised.\n\nThe one good thing I can say.  The art team went above and beyond.  The visual potential of this game will be used as a measuring stick for years.  Sadly, so will it's overall failure.",

I don't think it lived up to the hype, and it wasn't perfect on launch, but I didn't find it to be completely unplayable like some others have said.\n\nBut please for the love of God, fix the AI. \nDriving in traffic is next to impossible. They stop for no reason, stay stopped at green lights, and just seem to have no control over their vehicles. Makes GTA V traffic look like a driving simulator.\nPedestrians just seem to spawn at random and disappear at random. You look and see someone, look away and look back and they're gone. They also frequently seem to dive out of the way in the wrong direction, so they actually go further into harms way.\n\nAlso, I have had a few items spawn too low to pick up, like rolls of cash stuck in the table, or cars stuck in the ground.\n\nThe storyline is pretty good, graphics are nice overall, and it has definitely gotten better since launch. Replayability is a bit of a question mark, because the main story is the same pretty much no matter what, and changing the story at the beginning only changes the first 10 minutes, and some dialogue options. Still good for 40+ hours if you take your time.",

        "content": "I played this game on a 3070 with a 5600x with Ultra settings and DLSS on in 1440p and the FPS can really fluctuate depending on how the environment is. In really crowded areas I could easily get drops down to 40-50 FPS but im probably averaging about 80-90 FPS which is decent enough for me. Weirdly enough, my game has NEVER crashed on me. Visual bugs are quite common, sometimes boss names would not disappear after a fight and sometimes my POV get zoomed in after important dialouges (?), those were easy to fix tho with just reloading the game and I didnt find it disturbing.\n\nThe best part about this game is the characters, the voice acting and the storytelling. Its very easy to get attatched to the main characters in this game since they feel so real because of their amazing voice acting and their backstories, the missions are very unique and they dont get repetetive at all which is a huge plus. The main story of the game is really short which is quite disappointing but there are many different unique and decent-long side quests that makes up for the short main story, and yes I personally think they are better than the main story itself.\n\nThe soundtrack is also awesome in this game and really fits the vibe the city is giving you, maybe for the first time ever in a video game I actually have the radio on in a veichle when im going from point A to B. Graphics are the best ive ever seen in a video game, a couple of times I just stopped whatever I was doing and just wanted to watch the beauty of Night City. I never felt like the need to fast travel to a loaction because I really wanted to have a look at the enviornment and surrondings in this game. Driving has been improved alot in patch 1.2 and it doesnt feel like the fastest cars are driving on ice anymore. One thing i DO HATE tho is the minimap in this game and how small it is, since its so small you cant really drive fast around the city or else you risk missing a turn you are supposed to take. It might not sound like a huge problem, but trust me it really gets on your nerve after a while.\n\nMovement in this game is actually really fun and satisfying once you get used to it. One of the things i enjoyed the most playing this game was to buy the double jump implant to get around the city/the area you are doing a mission in since you are giving alot of freedom in this game when it comes to movement, it added alot to the futuristic experince as a whole. The cyberware system is also very awesome to use in this game and if you create your character in the right way it will feel so satisfying to use if you execute it in the right way. Replayability is quite good in this game when it comes to building out your character different every single time and how you want to build out your relationship with different characters\n\nCombat/gunplay is okay I guess, but that is mostly weighted down by the bad AI in this game. When it comes to the NPC complaint, it didnt really bother me that much since it didnt ruin my experience in the game. Crafting is also pretty bad and I didnt even have any use of it all, completely irrelevant for me. There are ALOT of GIGS/NCPD missions in this game, sadly they get repetetive really quick and its very often: Kill this guy or Steal this data type of job.  The open world aspect of this game is also pretty underdeveloped in my eyes with almost nothing to do if you are not doing missions, especially the romances is a huge let down once you are done with their main quests.\n\nThe difficulty can be really inconsistent somtimes and I would even call it broken.In the first half of the game when you are pretty low geared, the difficulty does its job and its pretty challenging. But in the second half of the game once you get better weapons and gear it just becomes too easy, even on the hardest difficulty, idk what it is but this needs to be fixed since its kind of ruining the endgame just plowing right through it and its the same thing every time and im on my 3rd playthrough as of right now writing this review.\n\nConclusion: 8/10",

It's not perfect, as I'm sure you've heard already if you're looking at this in 2021; there are some shallow game systems, some things are poorly explained, and if you look too deep into the clockwork of Night City, some of the fa\u00e7ade falls apart. However, this game\u2014in my experience\u2014has not been as buggy as I've been promised it would be by editorial reviews and community content (I played it on PC exclusively). The positives include some excellent writing, gorgeous visuals, and an *absolutely killer* soundtrack.\n\nAt the end of the day, what matters is how much I enjoyed the experience. And to give you some idea of that measure, I finished my first playthrough at 107 hours and started a second one as soon as the credits stopped rolling.",

Buying this after patch 1.2, I experienced minimal bugs, mostly related to the AI acting weird, which is also my only major complaint about this game (Pedestrians all acting similarly and cars randomly stopping in the middle of the road). There isn't as much depth in casually roaming around like in Rockstars' games, but everything else, the futuristic feel, the theme of dystopian capitalism and the narrative especially is great, as one would expect from CD Projekt. From a story perspective, the game has a lot of depth. I know it is popular to clown on Cyberpunk 2077 for the disastrously buggy launch and unplayability on previous gen consoles, but I would definitely recommend this game and I'm sure it will only get better with future patches and DLCs. I played 83 hours of Cyberpunk 2077 in a week and can't wait to play more, that alone should say all that you need to hear.",

Extremely rare encounters of glitches so far and I am 18 hours in to this brand new play through.\n\nThe new outfit system makes the game way more immersive as I can look how I want and still upgrade all my gear.

It's not perfect, but if you look past the quirkiness and just dive into Night City for what it is then you will have an appreciation for the game and what's to come in the future. Now for my experience I was hesitant on buying because of all the negative comments against them, but I am glad I took the gamble and after 93 hours in and I'm still happily roaming night city and enjoying the side quest as I grind my character to Beast Mode status. \n\nIf you want a perfect game, 100% real physics and realism then stray away. If you want to go into another fantasy world, just take it for what it is and enjoy the show this is the game for you!",

I will keep playing it for a long time.\n\nI do not have a highend computer but found how to play it with max quality, virtual consoles are the furture of gaming FYI, i will recommend it and say to you who think your computer will not handel it: you don't need more than a good internet connection  and think outside the box about playing in virtual PCs.\n\nFor my final review i will end the game and publish it in my youtube channel, there are things i think could be better design, i love this game, but to be objective (taking all the stuff about its realease outside) first i have to see the end credits screen.\n\n#cyberpunk2077 #CDProjektRED #LudietLoquitur #LEL",

But believe me, this game is truly amazing. if your PC is entry level(1050 ti - regular 1660), you should definitely wait a while for performance  patches and a price drop. If your PC is mid end or higher( at least a 1660 super), you will definitely have a fun time with the game. \n(Note to RTX users, turn on DLSS on the auto mode. Helps A TON with fps)\nThe game definitely did not come with the promised features it had been hyping up, which disappointed me a little.

I'm glad some people have had great experiences with it, but every time I boot it up to try and power through it to experience the story, some dumb glitch happens that reminds me why I gave up in the first place. Really disappointing.\n\nEDIT: I've come back to this game post 1.6 and Edgerunners and my immersion has completely flipped. I started a new run and frankly had an amazing time so far, and I can't see myself stopping any time soon. Glad to see the devs have brought this around to at least be a good game, even if it's not everything it could have been. I do hope that folks at least see the potential that Night City has and that the second pass goes better and more smoothly than the first.",

Guns blazing, stealth ninja, hacker, or melee weapons like swords, hammers, bats and knives and fist. Theirs cool implants that drastically change the feel of the game, like gorilla arms and mantis blades, and the double jump leg implant lets you run on the roofs of night city.\n\nAll the bad stuff you've already heard and knowing and experiencing all of it since day 1, that I still love playing it, I literally bought a gaming desktop just for this game (cries in PS4) so the key is to go in with an open mind.",

This games story is real good and is somewhat linear with how your character developes and how story progression goes, but it makes up with having interesting characters and a good way of pulling the player in, I would rate this game a 9.5 out of 10.",

Now the game is at a ok level.  The AI seems to be improved and the lighting of the game is improved.  But old bugs are re-surfaced like Jacky walk through my car, there's conversation sound missing, etc.  And I really hope they completely redo the police system.  Let the police teleport farther only make us easier to escape them.  Then what's the point of having it?\n\nre-edit: upon further playing, the old bugs that were gone are coming back.  Car floating in the air, npc walks right through wall, enemies frozen and not attack, etc.  which only means 1.2 is not tested before release... again.  I understand a lot of people urges for this patch.  But getting it out unready is still bad.",

This game is awesome to play and super fun, sure the bugs can be a problem but they are pretty funny to see also. The character story is good, the side characters are good, overall its a great game, only thing I would add is for them to add more interactions with the character you choose to romance, its more like a hit it and keep in touch romance rather than what other games have had, and make a better ending, I won't spoil anything but there is only 1 really decent ending to it all, otherwise its not the best endings. If i was to rate this game now, I'd say a solid 9/10, only thing preventing a 10/10 would be the ending and interactions with other side characters after their missions are done, otherwise I can't wait to see what DLC they have and if they make a sequel with your character or anything like that, get the game, you'll have fun, trust me.",

The story is great and makes you want to go for another 5+ hours whenever you hit a major plot point. \n\nThe hacking is a LOT of fun and is done in a way that is my favorite of any \"hacking\" mechanic I've experienced. \n\nThe driving is difficult to get used to, I mostly stick to the good 'ole Akira bike cause it's sexy as hell but this is the only open world game I can say that I'm able to go 5 hours without fast traveling let alone no fast traveling at all like I've done so far with my current/first playthrough. \n\nThe skill tree is huge, I've mostly focused down crafting/hacking paths. The Crafting is probably one of my largest gripes, they need a bulk craft option rather than crafting a few hundred of the same item... one at a time... just to grind up xp for the crafting tree...\n\nIs it buggy? Yeah, that's not really a question at this point with all the s!@# flung at the game for it. Is it worse than your typical Bethesda game 10 years after release? No, but that also doesn't excuse anything. But I'm the type that can take your typical bug in stride and just laugh it off.",

He just switches around randomly.\nOpen World feels like it was made in 2006.\nSide Missions get repetetive extremely fast as they are basically the same thing over and over again.\nAlso you can see civilians just walk by a visible crime going on nearby and not give a single fuck.\n\nThe only real upside is the graphics in general if you wait for the polygons to appear.\n\ntl;dr:\nOn Rails Open World.\nUnrelatable or upright annoying characters.\nChoices dont Matter.\nAI is brick lvl.\nGraphic looks nice if it manages to load.\nSkilltree is completely unbalanced.\nHigher difficulty just means you die faster and enemies become bullet sponges.

Say what you want about CoD, but at least the shooting feels fun and interesting and not like I'm underwater tied together with chains. Took me the first combat encounter to realize this is another boring bullet sponge FPS where I'm going to be using forgettable weapons against re-skinned enemies for an arbitrary Appropriately Long Game Time of 50 hours. There are free games that deliver this bland game play but actually let you play the second the game finishes downloading, instead of providing a torturous intro where you meet exciting and interesting characters like \"Kirk\" and \"Pepe\" and forcing you to witness a more fun game played out in non-interactive cut scenes. \n\nThis is a marketing team attempting to make the illusion of a video game. No patch, DLC, etc. will ever fix this. Without the bugs, performance issues, and the multitude of other problems, this would still be uninspired.",

Fairly deep into the game, 2nd playthrough just about over, and Patch 1.2 dropped.\n\nPatch 1.2 has just about killed my entertainment with the game.\n\nIn a Single Player game, at least in my opinion, the most critical bugs to patch out are those that harm gameplay or break immersion. It's for this reason that I understand why the painting exploit was removed, and similarly why I do not understand the removal of the Kerenzikov Dodge glitch. This glitch set Cyberpunk 2077 apart from other Single Player experiences, it allowed you to travel significantly faster than your running speed and made getting around Night City an absolute blast. With the release of Patch 1.2, this was removed. The removal of this glitch makes most situations of travel just involve finding the closest Fast Travel station and skipping the entire journey. It causes an awkward disparity between your horizontal and vertical movement and feels unsatisfying to play. There technically is a way to still perform this glitch, but it requires you to use a Sandevistan, which makes the glitch less accessible and have a significantly greater cooldown.\n\nI can't recommend Cyberpunk 2077 after this update, however I would recommend the game if you can downpatch it before 1.2, as I can genuinely say that it is a very fun game, with high mobility firefighting and a semi-fleshed out leveling system.",

When the game wasn't breaking, it was clear there was a very in depth RPG open world game here. I think the story with this game is far from over, and I expect that in the near future this game will truly shine.\n\nIf you:\n\n1. Have a system with a 1650 or higher graphics card.\n2.

Jackie is one my true role model of this game someone like him is honestly really inspiring it really does blow that he doesn't get that much story telling on how he was before he met V which speaking of V. V's voice actor did an amazing job at showing her characters emotions and how everything she does around her I won't go into much detail since I do want this review to be spoiler free. How these 2 character I love so much and can relate to the situations they've been in emotional this game is one of my top games really high up there, please whenever you do get the chance give this game a shot it really is worth playing this game and it keeps getting better and better",

But other than that I think the game is very good right now and with a patch or two like this one, the game could reach what was promised.",

        "content": "At first I was upset like anybody else, but after few hours of playing I simply love this game and I definitely recommend it. If I am upset about anything then it is false promises of the management, but not the game itself. Once I backed up a little bit and told to myself - Ok, here is this cyberpunk genre game, let's start again and play it with clean head I actually realized it's unbelievably good. Here is why.\n\nGraphics: Although I have only GTX1650 graphics is quite detailed and wherever I look it tends to focus itself, so the overall impression is very good. I expected much worse.\n\nMusic: I love it, really one of the coolest things about this game is soundtrack (JVZL - Circus Minimus is my favorite).\n\nGameplay: Here is where things come interesting. After playing it a while I started to notice similarities between Wither 3 and CP2k77. Calling for vehicle felt like whistling for Roach. Dialogs had similar feelings. Minimap too. Interestingly its' quite easy to steal (if there is anything like stealing at all, I didn't noticed). Fight also felt similar to W3. Surprisingly enough I actually didn't miss the 3rd person view although I do understand that the overall scenery together with main protagonist would be magnificent. Also the crafting of thins and searching for new schematics felt like wondering around Skellige for better armor. \n\nThese are all just minor thing one notice immediately. Now comes the 'wow' part:\n\nDetails.\n\nI haven't seen paying so much attention for details as in this game. To name few:\n- characteristic of city landscape changes from part to part relatively naturally, but you can definitely feel the vibe\n- different accents of different gang groups\n- detailed models of motorcycles (even on lower graphic profiles). For example I had red windshield and when I look through it I could actually see the red world.\n- characters really reacts on you depending on how you treat them\n- finally someone gave me an option to go down the path of pieces instead of peace if someone really pissed me off, although all story lines up to that moment indicated I won't be able to clean the place\n- realistic looking newspapers in the shops\n- there are no (at least I didn't noticed) two same shops in the game (like for example food stores or weapons stores)\n\nand many many more. Dev team really put an effort to this, they had to thing about it and that made me actually love the game.\n\nWhen it comes to cons. You all know that. Occasional glitches. In some missions you remain stuck, e.t.c. I don't need to name them, whole web is full of them and I blame the management of Project Red for pushing the idea that game is basically finished although it wasn't.\n\nOverall I do recommend this game. Don't expect it to be extraordinary and you will be surprised.",

This is the first game I've ever pre-ordered, due to having been excited about it for so long - I'm one of those gamers who generally waits a few months/a year, to allow any kinks to be worked out before I join in, but I just couldn't wait for this. \nIn all honesty, I was still half expecting the P.C, version to have a few issues, however, as someone who normally plays on Console (I got a gaming P.C to be able to handle music production) I was very pleasantly surprised.\n At around 67 Hours in, I am so, so, happy with Cyberpunk 2077. I've had 0 hardware issues & only a handful of glitches (nothing major, just the helmet & hair not spawning when I get on a bike & occasionally having to enter the menu to stop my character from targeting). It seems like these issues are being addressed in the latest update which is currently downloading... Which is another thing... I can't believe how quickly so many minor details are being addressed! I love that CDPR have really bothered to make sure everyone has a great experience. \nThe storylines are very immersive & the graphics are incredible - Night City is STUNNING! The whole game is just a sight to behold - Never before have I found myself stopping and Screencapturing everything... From scenic views, to city scapes, to just interesting background characters. I find myself invested in the characters we interact with & wanting to stay on that bit longer to find out more about them & where their storyline is heading. Oh, & the map is huge! Even with this many hours put in, I am well aware that there are still some areas I haven't completely explored & which no doubt have more gigs, side jobs & missions to present themselves.\nI 100% recommend this game to everyone. It feels as though I am witnessing one of the defining games in History.",

If you look at this game through the lens of a 2020 era game, yeah there is a whole lot about which to complain, but when you consider the development window and look at it as an older game, it is far more enjoyable. It's a fun romp of game design from a bygone era.",

        "content": "I absolutely love this game. I haven't played it much since it launched, yet I still find myself thinking about the story and all of the characters I met. If you only plan on blasting through quests without paying much attention to the story or small details (such as reading what's on the terminals and listening to background conversations), then you probably won't enjoy it as much as I did, but I think it'd still be very fun regardless!\n\nCombat gets progressively more fun and engaging the higher you level up, and there are a lot of different combat paths you can take. If you're like me and you're not sure how to make cool builds, I recommend looking up tutorials on what guns/perks you should use. Make sure you get cybernetics from ripperdocs; there's so much you can do with them. Personally, I found quickhacks to be my favorite part of combat. Once you get legendary quickhacks, there are so many different routes you can take every combat encounter. Want to make the guards outside kill themselves after a delay while you go around back and stab the other enemies with mantis blades? Go ahead! Made a mistake and got caught sneaking? Wipe their memory long enough so you can kill them and hide their body! Etc.\n\nThis game especially shines in the characters and lore. You can really tell how much the world is fleshed out when you pay attention to the small details included in different locations. Every single quest has an interesting story to tell (of course, some are more interesting than others), and a lot of the quests have ethical dilemmas that really made me think about my decisions. On a similar note, I love how intercultural Night City is and how the different subdistricts have their own styles and histories. It's fun to go to the different locations and see what languages are being spoken and what topics are being talked about. And Night City is so beautiful and detailed!!! I can't emphasize enough how cool the city looks. Even after all the time I've spent on this game, I sometimes like to just spend time driving around in first-person POV on a motorcycle as I look around at the cityscape.\n\nI thought that the characters in this game were extremely well-written. The animation for body language and facial expressions only enhance how realistically they act in dialogues. They feel like real people - not just NPCs catering to V's actions. And I like that the NPCs you interact with a lot have flaws that don't make them 100% likable all the time. I also appreciate that you can call characters at any nearly any point in the story. Of course, there's going to be limited dialogue (there's never going to be infinite dialogue options in games, unfortunately), but it helps make the characters feel like they have their own shit going on outside of V. This is a very emotional game, and some of the storylines are extremely serious and deal with intense topics. It handled said topics very well, in my opinion, and I loved the dark nature of many of the quests. I haven't played any other open-world video game that made me quite as emotional as this game.\n\nThe MUSIC! My God, I love the music in this game. The soundtrack and the radio songs are all bangers (although the Vexelstrom radio station gets played a bit too much for my liking, lol). The combat music is really intense and it always gets me pumped to kill the enemies, and I love the music during the more emotional moments as well. There are a lot of different genres in the radio stations, and I think everyone will find at least one that really caters to their liking. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game if you love the cyberpunk genre and are looking for a gritty story with fleshed out characters. This is very much an RPG similar to Witcher 3, so don't go in expecting to meaningfully interact with random citizens or be able to go into every single building. I think there was a lot of hype for the game (I didn't keep up with it, so I'm not fully aware of what was expected by the general population), but I think the backlash upon initial launch overshadowed the many, many positive aspects this game has. At the time of writing this, there are definitely still at least some visual bugs and awkward NPC movements/interactions, but I have only ever crashed once and none of the bugs have ruined my immersion. \n\nSeeing as it still isn't a perfect game, I'll settle on a 9/10 because some of the storylines could have been more fleshed out and there are more bugs than I would have wanted. However, Patch 1.2 was just released, and I think the development team is actively working hard to make the game as perfect as it can be in the long-run. I would recommend waiting if you want a mostly bug-free experience (although it seems the recent patch has fixed a decent amount), but if you're like me and don't get bothered too much by occasional glitches, then go ahead and play right now!",

I recently bought it on steam and began my journey anticipating some issues but hoping for nothing too significant. I was pleased with the world building and atmosphere but every time I play there are many visual glitches and some that effect my character by propelling him across distances. These glitches don't necessarily bother me much after they happen, some are kinda funny and none have had any major effects when it comes to the core elements of the game. All in all the game is very fun and very in depth so I do think the positives outweigh the negatives and I would recommend it for players who really love RPGs.",

I loved the story, and every bit of action in between.  Characters feel realized and well-thought-out.  There is so much to do, I literally spent about 25 hours so far just doing side quests and walking around the city looking at things (and I haven't finished them all).  On top of that, CD Projekt didn't waste any time and included a bunch of the game's assets right there in the game folder for you to enjoy: soundtrack, wallpapers, etc.\n\nYou can tell that they really want to be proud of this game, and they are still working hard to improve everything about it.

Looking forward to future expansions.",

        "content": "After playing this game off and on since release, I've warmed up to it. Sort of.\n\nThe main plot is interesting and fun but CDPR completely lied about choices mattering, that multiple choice dialogue will give you some different lines but the end result is usually the same. The character path that you choose at the beginning also does NOTHING, you'll still end up with the same cutscene and the same gameplay. There are maybe 2 or 3 important decisions to make through the main plot and even then, they don't change a great deal. \nThe best thing about it has actually been the side quests, I've found a lot of them have been incredibly more fun and interesting to play than the main plot missions are. There are some truly amazing detective style questlines to find and they've really stood out because of their unexpected twists and turns, sometimes taking turns to the nightmarish and gruesome. \n\nAfter that comes the visuals. It was a buggy game in the beginning but it's started to mature now with the latest patches. I love the experience of driving around at night in the rain, few other games look this good and have such an intoxicating atmosphere. \n\nNow as for the bad, it's the AI. All of it. Pedestrians are morons, car AI is the worst I've seen and the AI of police and enemies is done so poorly that it's comical. No matter where you are, even standing on top of a streetlight, a cop will teleport behind you if you've gained a wanted level. There are no car chases at all and no pursuit mechanics at all which is a major disappointment in such a large city with plenty of roads to have a chase down.\n\nBuy this on discount and enjoy it for what it is, it doesn't deserve the full price considering all the very blatant lies about the development.",

        "content": "I know my profile says 9 hours but due to internet tips and tricks i turned off the cloud sync to this game and have actually played closer to 170 hours, in 3 different runs. With that out of the way I want to make one more disclaimer: This game is incredibly flawed, and I don't just mean the technical issues, the city somehow as beautiful and expansive as it is feels dead. There isn't a lot of variation in things to do, enemy AI is non-existent, NPC AI is non existent, Driving ranges from arcade-like to \"holy shit i wish they brought back Roach, I know it wouldn't fit but ANYTHING is better than this.\" That all said, I do recommend this game.\n\nIn all my hours playing this game, I think it would be best described as an action adventure title with a little bit of a \"choose your own adventure novel\" mixed in. The characters are by and large well written and interesting, and this game shines like a diamond in my opinion, with its interactions between V and Johnny Silverhand. The story is alright, i feel like too many things were left ambiguous for the sake of feeling \"Sci-fi\" however, it is very much a story worth sitting through. I enjoyed this game most as sort of a time waster, it doesn't take a lot of commitment to progress, the world is absolutely gorgeous and I didn't mind sometimes doing nothing more than inhabiting it, also, by the end of the game its just a pure power fantasy and all in all, approaching this game with that expectation might make it significantly more enjoyable. \n\nThe combat is serviceable, not great, shooting actually feels surprisingly tight and melee combat is floaty as all hell but all together the variation in ways you can approach any given combat scenario actually does help keep it engaging. This games side quests can get incredibly repetitive and often times I couldn't remember weather or not I had completed certain sidequests because I was never truly sure what features made it into the game or not (in this instance the street cred system locking you out of lower tiered missions as you advance.) \n\nI honestly want to love this game, but I just don't. I keep wanting to say somewhere in this review its almost a great game, but that isn't true either. This is a solid game, that should be purchased on sale, that has fleeting moments of brilliance, that almost had me believing through patches they could \"fix\" the game, but in order to make this go from a pretty good game to a great game, it would need to be a different game. \n\nIf you are looking for a shut your brain off, open world sci-fi experience with a compelling story and a visually stunning world I wholly recommend this game, but honestly it really isn't much more than that. I think I spent most of my 170 hours trying to make it more than that. All in all, I'm glad I gave it the chance I did, but if you were expecting that at some point CDPR would turn this all around and make this game the \"next-gen\" experience they advertised, this isn't it and it likely never will be. \n\nI know my review seems mostly negative, but I did enjoy my time in Night City, and if they ever release a proper sequel and managed to stick the landing, there is the framework of a truly great experience here. All in all at the time of writing, I certainly do not mind saying goodbye to it either.\n\n7/10, get in on a decent sale, and play at your leisure. \n\nThanks for coming to my Ted Talk.",

There are elements to this game that IMHO deserve the term Masterpiece.  They include: music, graphics, story and characters.  Turns out these are the main things I look for in a game.  Things needing improvement are well publicized: Occasional visual glitches, and NPC and Police AI.  That being said, these things didn't take away from experience for me.  There were moments in this game that made me feel real emotion, more so than any other game I have ever played and rivaling the best movies I have seen.  I recently finished the main story and plan to play through again shortly.  The level of detail to explore in Night City is breathtaking.  Love or hate CDPR: you have to at least acknowledge what they have managed to accomplish here and the issues with the open world aspects of the game should only get better with patches.  I truly wish them success in the future.",

        "content": "Updated Edit 5-26-2021 at the bottom.\n\nThis game is extremely disappointing. It is hard to put into words just how flawed this game really is. The corporate decision to release this game early was a massive mistake. This game feels like an early alpha test of the game. So many features are either missing or not working at all.\n\nIf you are interested in getting this game and are looking for negative reviews to see how bad the game is, this next part is for you: while the game can be fun at times when you ignore the main story and enjoy whatever quests or just wandering around night city aimless, the main crux of the game is just hindering. At some point in gameplay you can clearly tell the shift in development where the game switched from being an open world rpg to a linear action game. There are so many things that the game hints at and implies for you to do, but be prepared to be disappointed that every single thing you thought might exist in the game simply does not. Because it's locked by behind some door that will never open and dreams never realized.\n\nQuick Q&A:\nWould I recommend this game? \nNo. \n\nShould you wait for this game to be updated and fixed? \nDon't get your hopes up for it. So much is wrong with the game that a fundamental rework from the ground up is needed. This game might be good in like 3 years, and great in 5. But I could easily see this game being dropped in about a year's time from ever being updated again.\n\nIf you didn't like the game and wrote this review, then why are you still playing it?\nHonestly the game is flawed and missing a ton of stuff. Some joy can be found in the game by ignoring the main story quest and doing your own thing, but then the flaws become even more apparent. It can be fun to roam around and do your own thing.\n\nTLDR:\nPlay this game if you are curious how much content is missing, not working, or other ways you can break the game. Don't get this game if you want a polished AAA open world rpg game.\n\n~~~Update 5-26-2021~~~\nAs of now I have put in about 100 hours into this game, doubling my previous time since I last wrote to this review. Since my first post to this review, patch 1.2 and hotfixes 1.21 and 1.22 have come out. The biggest improvements that I personally noticed from these updates were: 1) police are not as annoying as they spawn farther away 2) icons being updated in the UI helps to see at a glance what type of grenade or item you are looking at and finally 3) the ability to turn off the annoying dash by double tapping on keyboard in the settings menu. \n\nI have also as of writing this, completed all the major side gigs and NCPD's on the map (minus one in pacfica that I need to unlock somehow). I have around 50% completion towards achievement, and all I have left in the game is the major side quests, and the story itself. \n\nHaving put in 100 hours into this game, I do sit and wonder to my self why I still keep coming back to this game in its broken state. After all I have much better games in my steam library that I could be playing. Heck most the games I have ever played have not reached 100 hours worth of gameplay. So why do I still keep playing this game while at the same time not recommend it? To answer the first part, it's honestly because I do have fun in the game. To answer the second part: the game itself though still fails on what I want from it. I was sold this game on the idea of a decision heavy rpg game. What I got was an action game with rpg elements. It seems that somewhere during all the advertisements and the development of this game, they had realized that this game could not meet the fan expectations, let alone what they wanted to see in the game themselves. \n\nI do wonder what the state of this game will look like in a few years. Will this be the next skyrim for modding? Will this game pull a comeback similar to no man's sky? Or will this game simply sink away to oblivion, simply being known as the game that disappointed? It's hard to tell.\n\nI personally want to see this game succeed. After having put so much time into the game, I can see the remains of passion that were once there, but now are washed out by corpo greed. So many areas simply blocked off by invisible barriers that have me wondering what it would have been there. Especially with the teasing message of: \"Nothing here for you... yet\". It feels like the game wants me to speculate on what was there, why it wasn't finished or put into the game. \n\nI do feel bad for the people of this project. I don't feel like it was their fault the game got released in this state. It is also a bit sad anytime I see the social media trying to do any sort of basic communication to the fans of this game through either announcements or stats, that the entire comment section is filled with nothing more than just comments saying things along the line of \"DeAd GaME!\" \"FIX THE GAME\" \"BROKEN GAME\".  That being said, I do think it's fair the player base is so mad about this game's state of release. I am too. I mean, that's why I am wrote this review. It's why I'm editing this review right now.\n\nAnyway, I thought I would update this review I wrote some time ago to further put my thoughts out there. I am not the best writer and this really is just more or less my ramblings posted online. I don't know how to end this, but I do intend on writing another update to this at some point. So, a question to future me, how do you like the game now?\n\n~~Update 11/24/2021~~\nHad to edit one of my reviews for the steam awards nominations badge, so I choose this one. Since last writing no major updates have come out for the game and the game is still missing a massive amount of content. You want more from the game? Then there are mods. Have a good one!",

        "content": "So I patiently waited to play this game, I avoided pretty much all the trailers and news on it, and I think that is why I was able to enjoy it without any unreasonable expectations. I was looking for a story based rpg, and I got exactly what I ordered. If you went in expecting the second coming of Christ in game form, of course you'll be disappointed. Of course, that doesn't mean I don't have criticisms, but they are realistic based on the genre.\n\nSo the nitty gritty, for the price and my love of story rich rpg's I will say I absolutely recommend this game. My first play through was ~87 hours, and I missed a few things. Sure, it could have been longer, but I don't feel it needed to be. It may have even dragged too much in the second chapter with more squeezed in, from a pure story telling standpoint. So I had no issues really with the story, and although some may find the endings bleak, I felt they were right on the money for a dystopian game. \n\nThe characters were so well written, even the minor ones. The voice acting really brought them to life, too. They also did a phenomenal job with animating their facial expressions. I was enamored with their designs as a whole.\n\nThe environment felt very alive, walking around with crowds on, in the middle of Night City was very very immersive for me. The AI on random NPC's isn't groundbreaking or anything but the number of people and cars bustling about really drove home the sheer size of the place. With headphones on and everything cranked on high settings, it felt pretty real to me. However I understand that not every machine will be able to have everything cranked up like I did. Even with my rig, I only averaged ~87 fps at 2k resolution, where other games I generally have no issues getting 140's. \n\nThe art department really deserves the highest praise here, the designs from the clothes, to the cars, to the buildings and advertisements were fantastic. I often found myself ogling Npc's on the street, jealous that they seemed to have access to clothes I didn't!\n\nMy biggest gripe here is how many pieces of the game fell flat. For instance, the romance; Like most rpg's that have romances, they feel hollow once you've completed the arc with the person you are chasing. On top of that, you are limited to one option per sexuality. I'm fine with them not being \"player sexual\" meaning they don't care what the pc is, but at least two different options per would have really felt a little better. There are several characters that absolutely should have been romanceable, and maybe were planned but ended up being scrapped? Hell, they flirt with you regardless, but if you return the favor they just shoot you down. Just felt strange at points. \n\nCharacter creation/customization seemed very basic and flat too. For a world with tons of cyberware....where the hell are they? Lots of great hairstyles....that you can never change once in game. Why include the mirrors everywhere if they are pointless? Why do I have to go into a shop to buy clothes, when everything else is vending machines, and why is it RNG based? My V spent many days in front of shops trying to get the gear I wanted.  You can't even get more tattoos [spoiler] and the ones you can get, take up a cyberware slot, which takes the fun right out if you are min/maxer at all. [/spoiler]\n\nAlso, all those fun buildings and neat places....well you can't get into what felt like most of them. There are plenty of hidden things to find and explore, but it felt like the game gave mixed signals. You'd see a place that looked full of secrets to be met with some impenetrable door, then later find a place the seems innocuous that has cool shit inside. I was never sure when I should take the time to explore. \n\nVehicles were super fun to look at, but are horrendous to drive at first. I did get better at it, and figured out I did best on the motorcycles, but still...yikes. Seems like they are trying to tinker with it, and I'm sure it feels better with a controller setup, but I prefer m/k. \n\nThe calling and text messaging system was both neat to me, but also felt a little lazy? On one hand, I loved that they would just randomly call or text, but the in person interactions were so well done it seemed a shame some of the convos weren't in person. However, some of the text chains were a real delight in the way they were written, so I'm very torn there. I also ran into a snag with a call not applying to the quest directive, and had to fix it via the console by forcing the call again. \n\nThe crafting was interesting, and actually making things was gratifying. Being able to rummage materials from crappy items was nice too. What I didn't like, was that there were a very limited amount of designs, and the rarity couldn't be upgraded. Yet iconic items could? Then there is this entirely other upgrading system that uses WAY too many materials that it's barely worth the minuscule gains. I would have much rather they scrapped the shitty upgrade system, and give me a larger variety of crafting patterns that can be upgraded to better rarities, so when you find that jacket or shoes you like you don't have to scrap them for better gear that isn't visually what you want. \n\nSpeaking of that, why wasn't the full body slot used more? For instance, why couldn't I just create an outfit in the mirror or something that uses that slot, and looks like what I want visually, but I can put the actual good gear in the clothing slots? Seemed wasted.\n\nI found the busy quests enjoyable, even the random NCPD ones. If you take the time to actually read the shards and stuff, they are like mini stories that sometimes branched to other ones. I could see others finding them tedious, but I made sure to do every one of them -- sadly one bugged and I couldn't seem to fix it so I didn't get that achievement sadly. \n\nUltimately, I feel like there should have been more ways to role play. I mean, it's a role playing game, why can't my V have more chrome, or a see through jacket? It really feels like these things were intended, but the whole game just got out of hand with the things they planned to put in. You could tell some real thought was put into things, like the subway, but just didn't make the cut. \n\nTL;DR:\nOverall, I found lots to enjoy in Night City. I really love single player story driven rpgs, and it was those things. Games are going to have bugs here and there, and there will always be features that you wish were included. I think If you go in with realistic expectations, there is a very fun game here, with lots to do and explore, that it will be worth the ticket price for most gamers. I for one, will be trying a second go round at a higher difficulty, a new romance target and work towards one of the other endings!\n\n====Updated for 1.6====\nThere have been some changes to the game since my initial review that have all been positive! The biggest being able to transmog your outfit, and crazily enough they pretty much did it exactly how I had described using the outfit slot!! They've also added more quests, more iconics and reworked the builds. The romance lines got some new text messages, and while they are cute, are still pretty hollow. The characters themselves are still very impressive which makes up for this. They added quite a bit more character customization but still no body cyberware options (thank goodness for mods.) You can also now change some of it at the ripperdocs. Otherwise, they have done quite a bit of bug fixing, driving adjustments and AI changes that did help overall. The last few playthroughs have been perfect with no issues for me. Overall I still recommend this game for folks who like story rpgs!",

It asks us about our own souls, our own choices, and it uses the Cyberpunk genre and Aesthetics to highlight these questions and themes NOT to make you gawk.\n\nDeus Ex shows us the effects that Augmentation will take on us. Not only could it create class and social divides but it could lead to the government having more and more ways to control the population, it could lead to us forgetting our own humanity.\n\nThe Matrix warns us of the dangers of Artificial Intelligence, and of the careful lines we must tow in our pursuit of technology if we wish to avoid creating our own coffin.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 tells us about: nothing. The game is about nothing. Yes it has a story, a very entertaining one with love-able characters and probably the best designed City in any Open World game so far. Each street of night city is sprawling with detail and story. But what is the purpose of this game? nothing. It could have explored things like self identity in a future age, if you can just buy a personality shard (an idea that lines up perfectly with this being a make your own character RPG) then where do you even start and end as a person? But instead it makes no comments, no observations or warnings. It does not risk that, it risks nothing. \n\nIf you love the Cyberpunk Genre as I have my whole life, then you will love walking through the rain soaked neon lit streets of night city and observing and interacting with the gangs and people and stories that are in there. \nBut if you are looking for another thought provoking piece of the genre it is named after then you will be dissapointed.\n\nThey can fix all the bugs, and add as many missions and updates as they want. But they cannot give the game a Vision.\n\n7/10",

Bugs aside, I thoroughly enjoyed this game.  The writing and storytelling surrounding the main characters (the NPCs who have the most content and impact) was top notch, reminding me of games like Mass Effect 2.  The main quest was also engaging and it felt like each possible ending choice would result in something potentially very different.  Side quests offer a lot of variety and support multiple solutions/pathways, though over time some of the Fixer missions get a bit monotonous.  I played primarily for story but the combat was not bad either.  Plenty of different directions you can build your character, though once you get enough skill points the combat encounters tend to be fairly easy.  I felt I got my money's worth out of the game from enjoying the story and the character interactions.  For me the game is a solid 8/10 just based on the writing, but your personal preferences may vary.  I will definitely replay it at least once to try a totally different character build and different choices, and I can see myself coming back to it again a year or two down the road, similar to The Witcher 3, to remind myself of what I liked about it.",

Night city is a beautifully crafted setting and the graphical fidelity blew me away (that is if you can run it on its high settings lol).

I honestly cant say the story is necessarily good, at no point was I enthralled or even felt part of it. in fact, most characters are annoying. I also think the driving mechanics are pretty lame unless you get the one good car; the best car isnt even the most expensive one. the saving grace of this game is absolutely the gameplay. Ive rolled stealth, tanks, and another that was almost purely hacking. crafting is essential in my opinion, added just enough to the game to keep playing after youve already beat everything and only had the last mission left. I have faith in it though, I need more content, expansions, DLC, something. the 1.3 update brought the game into an actual playable state fixing a large number of bugs. after the second play through every mission just felt like a chore, theres really no incentive for exploring. at some point in the end the only action youll find is by mowing down pedestrians and fighting off the police until you die, which can be fun, but still not enough reason to stay. \n\nat this point I feel I got my money's worth but I also see no reason to return outside of going for steam achievements, which I have never cared about. for new comers: I strongly encourage you to read through the skills and think about which direction you wanna go before ever applying a single skill point anywhere. youll get enough to max out 3, within the classes youll have to determine your approach. anyone that says you cant stealth in this game doesnt know how to build a stealth class, Ive completed entire missions without firing a single shot. \n\nall in all its a good game, nothing close to the hype that went into it, but its good. the gameplay really is the saving grace here. for now, I will be uninstalling it and waiting until more serious DLC/expansions come out if ever. my goal was to have an assortment of builds for the occasion and Ive achieved that goal. is it worth the $60 I paid? maybe, but I would absolutely suggest waiting for it to go on sale. Its good enough to get a recommendation, bad enough that I can say you will get bored during your second play through, theres just no surprises and literally nothing to really explore in depth. big city with nowhere to go. it is pretty fun running/jumping around on rooftops and dismembering people with a sword though. blasting people with the shotgun is super rewarding, lobbing grenades on grenades can be entertaining, I just wish Johnny would shut up. some butt hurt 30yo thats been dead for 50 years or something, complaining about corpos and using this second wind of living for the soul purpose of \"GeTtInG tHe BaNd BaCk ToGeThEr\", come on, and having to deal with that crap over and over again because there is absolutely no end game other than the game ending. only replay value is in re-rolls.",

        "content": "For context I went into Cyberpunk 2077 totally blind. I didn't watch any of the trailers, I didn't know anything about the world, characters save Keanu Reeves was in a starring role (How could you escape it?). I still knew of the hype of course, and when it finally came time for release I decided to go for it, looked like fun. \n\nHonestly, as someone who LOVES Bethesda, I thought a few bugs would be manageable and that people were likely overblowing the bugs for clicks etc. Hand on heart, yes its horribly buggy, and yes it is incredibly noticeable and has an adverse effect on the game... but I have in my 100 hours NOT encountered a truly game breaking bug and I was playing from day one. Are the bugs bad? Yes. Do they destroy the game? Not even close. \n\nI am not a CDPR fanboy, I have not played the Witcher games (Sue me), but this game is excellent. If you can look past the lack of polish (and I mean I don't think this game has even seen a bug tester) then what awaits you is a fantastic world inhabited by some of the best characters I've seen in a recent RPG, I won't wax lyrical about them but they feel well built and fleshed out, surprisingly human even. The world building is top notch, and words like Choom, Eddies Gonk and Corpo somehow feel like things that people would honestly say whereas I find trying to insert slang in these types of games fall flat on their face. The gameplay is a lot of fun, the gun play feels great, and the melee is somehow the most fun I've had in the game (this speaks to me as I tend to despise melee and often try to avoid it). The story is probably one of the weakest areas of the game. I never felt truly engaged within the grander narrative, it felt somehow played out and slightly contrived, but the characters make it totally palatable. \n\nThe strongest part of this game in my opinion is the main character, V. \nI have tried male and female V, and found the latter to fit better (IMO). V is one of those rare characters in a game where I felt truly interested in getting a good ending, and fell victim to the themes of the game, not being able to let go. Despite my initial fear of voice characters in RPGs and how they detract (yes I'm talking about Fallout 4) V manages to avoid that. The voice acting is not only incredible, but almost always feels like every take was perfect, never did I feel like there was a weird line or strange reading in over 100 hours. Furthermore despite having only 2-3 lines per interaction the voice acting is so compelling you tend to move on quickly and really personalise your V. Come for Keanu and stay for V honestly. \n\nThe weakest part of the game by far, is the sheer laziness of the features, or the lack thereof. \nIn a game all about modifying your body beyond recognition, you cannot change your hair. Let that sink in. My first V had a normal looking hairstyle and only once I was too far in (and now wanting to look different as the story had progressed) did I realise they... didn't have the option to change it? Baffling. \n\nThe Driving is terrible, every car feels like its on a ice lake and cars themselves are mostly pointless. You get 1-3 special cars and there is never a reason to buy another one. Car customisation was also left on the cutting room floor. \nI have mentioned the bugs already, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention it again. This game is totally unfinished and it shows, cutscenes \"Play out\" and objects float, if you don't look at someone while in a car their mouth stops moving, things like this really detract from the game, but aren't enough to ruin it. \n\nI'll wrap up here as that is as brief as one can be about Cyberpunk 2077. I eagerly await further content (and for CDPR to finish the game...) as I think its a gem, a Gem dropped in shit for sure, but give it a proper cleanup and you've got something that is going to really sparkle. I highly recommend this game if you can look past the bugs and general lack of polish.",

The bugs I experienced were actually manifesting AFTER the hotfix patches, but they seem to be gone as of now (16/03/2021).\n\nStill, I completed almost all of the endings and I'm on my second playthrough on the max difficulty just to hook up with Panam. The female V voice actor is almost always spot on. She's brilliant. The male V voice seems good too, but I'm early into the game with my male V, so the verdict on that is still out.\n\nWhen this game is at its best, it's a marvel to behold. When it's at its worst, you really hope they waited with the release for half a year. \n\nI saw the media campaign on it, and I thought to myself that the game journalists, if I may even call them that, suffer from the game journo disease. They play so many big open world games that they are basically bored with the genre as a whole, and even if the release was bug-free on day 1, they would lambast it just because it's not the second coming of gaming Christ.\n\nFor me, who skipped a LOT open world games, just because I have a life outside of gaming, this is a very solid proposal, and I enjoy my time in it very much.",

I still play Skyrim to this day so I'm used to playing around bugs instead of complaining. But the bugs did not hamper my enjoyment.\n\nI do not play this game like the Witcher, more like a Skyrim. Most of my time is going into my build, levelling and doing all the random stuff on the map. This game allows you to take it up for half an hour and do some small missions. You do not need to dedicate your life to it to finish it or to have a fun time playing.\n\nI like the story and the voice acting. I like the choices you have. It is not an endless choice labyrinth, The choices mainly come down to do I work on these side quests or not. If you are not paying attention, you do not even notice you made a choice. However if you are a completionist and do everything, it becomes more obvious when you have a choice.\n\nThe main thing I liked is that I could play a character which interacted with people the way I would (apart from the mindless killing of goons) and I got an ending which was in line with my choices. It was a satisfying conclusion to my story and fitted my character rather naturally.",

Gravity glitches, driving is a gigantic pain in the ass even with Mods, graphics sometimes go wanky. However, the story is great, personally i don't usually care about story, as long as i get to shoot stuff i'm happy. with this game the story is good, the characters are compelling. The violence has variety, you can walk through the front door of an interaction and blow everyone up, shoot people through walls and grenade everyone. you can also take out a knife and quietly stab everyone in the back, you can also fully load out your cyberware and digitally F everyone up from around the corner. It's fun.",

I have encountered the occasional graphic glitch, minor annoyances really. A few have been properly hilarious. To be honest i have found Bethesda games to have more issue than Cyberpunk.\n\nThe game itself is pretty good, I've enjoyed playing it. I will say after awhile the missions do get a bit repetitive and vehicle handling is garbage. Get the early mission bike (you know the one). From what I can tell it handles better than anything else in the game and is a blessing. At this point I can nit pick about design decisions and systems but those really haven't affected my recommendation. \n\nThe shining grace of the game is the narrative. Voice acting is top notch. Keanu Reeves delivery is just down right flawless. Loved Johnny, hated Johnny and laughed at him, just perfect. V (street kid) for the most part was relatable but it was the interactions with the NPCs that allowed the character to shine.  Don't skimp on the side quests. \n\nI paid 60 and feel i got my moneys worth. Probably more so once the Mods issues are address and I can start customizing the hell out of the game.",

I say wait for more patches and i think this game will be Awesome just line The Withcer 3 Wild hunt had alot of bug in the begining till it won the Game of the Year award, Bear with it, Don`t give up on this game yet! Gameplay is fun you get to shoot alot of things, guns in the game are actualy very nice especial the smart ones by useing the smart link cyberware. The story is nice but the endigs need work from my point of view all of them are bitter sweet or sad. Alot of content was cut from the game, the game should have 5 Acts not 3, alot of side quest just end abruptly like there are unfinished. The cars and bikes designes are actully pretty nice but their handling is kind of slugish and hard to handle. Is like i am playing Watch Dogs the driving in that game was the worst. To bad they cut the cutsceenes because they were nice like in the trailer, it would have made the story much nice like in the witcher 3. I would realy love to see more wepons varieties like in the Borderlads game. This game is not meant to be played like a multiplayer leave it sigleplayer CD Project.\nOfcours i did not forget the bad things in the game like the cops that apears out of nowere, the NPS are A.I is bad, But i think with some work from CD Project the game will become good like the company promised us but again we need to bear with it. From the beginning CD project should have deleyed the game till mid 2021 or for the holidays of 2021.",

The lore and world of the game are amazing but with the bugs and lack actual cyborg body parts you can have combined with barely present chimpsy role-play options this game has left a lot to be desired. I won't go into the bug/glitch nightmare because there are thousands of reviews to explain that. What I will say is I really like the story we were given but I don't love it. I definitely can say I truly cared for most of the main cast in the story and had great emotional and visually impressive moments but it all feels controlled as if I were playing an open world narrative and not so much rpg. The game should have dived deeper in the open world and role-playing and focused less on this major narrative they built. Or maybe it would have worked better for me if they just went straight Bioshock or Dishonored and dealt with less an open world and did more of a sandbox narrative rpg or something. Having this big world with almost nothing to do but stare at the vistas kills me because when you don't have a quest in your face the world is somehow a living ghost town. I feel like any choice I make or dialogue I choose is made to fit what \"V\" would say. In some cases it feels like my choices matter even less than in the Mass effect series, I know we weren't necessarily promised the role play depths of Fallout New Vegas. What I mean is that it feels as though \"V\" is a character U control but feels like a second wheel almost as if we were another Johnny. The game is more a narrative tale of \"V\" than a true RPG. Angry Joe pretty much sums up the review I would give this game.",

        "content": "Okay, after more than 100 hours into the game I think I can give an honest opinion now. \n\nLong and short of it is: I actually recommend this title, jank and all. \nA lot of crybabies whine about how broken the game is but frankly its in better shape than half of the AAA titles of the last decade even after years of patches and fixes. \nIt absolutely has problems, name one game this complex and massive that doesn't. Frankly that is a very tall order. \nHowever if you can accept that there are strange bugs and glitches and frankly some flat out janky coding and design, you will find an extremely fun and engrossing game. \nI actually enjoy the story, and often I find myself just walking around admiring the world they built. I do wish it was more fleshed out and deeper detail because theres a lot to draw you in, but no game is really that expansive. \n\nPro's: \nExpansive and lots of customization to get lost in, kindof like mass effect before they made it fit for children who couldn't get the customization systems. \nGenuinely interesting characters and story. I really like a lot of the characters and want to know more about them. \nExcellent soundtrack, but I would like more metal options myself lol. Doom ftw! \nBeutiful design and stunning visuals. \nvaried combat to fit your taste\n\nCons: \nCustomization can be cheesed real easy, as in I can become a lethal pistol sniper who is never spotted and take down late game enemies with ease at level ten. Really just needs more balancing as you are either OP beyond belief or get squashed like a bug, very little middle ground. \nI find that there is too little time with the awesome characters, like Jackie. I really wanted to play all the stuff that was in the opening montage as I felt this would have better served the world building and let the player really connect with characters that just get glossed over too quick and we would get some genuine time with Jackie who was done so well. That character reminds me of a homie I grew up with and I like him a lot. \nWhile the visuals are awesome, theres a looooot of polish and patching needed. bugs are very common and varied. \nvaried combat makes it really hard to balance as you can find easy ways to cheese the game no matter what. A more focused gameplay style would have done more to focus the game overall rather than a grab bag. \n\nAnd my biggest complaint really is the patches they drop. When I first got the game I didn't really experience many bugs or errors, occasional tpose or fazed character and minor graphical errors here and there. \nWith each successive patch my game gets less and less stable. Every time I see more and worse bugs and jank. Things that worked fine have gotten funky and the jank is getting very noticeable. \nI really hope the devs get to focus and just fix things rather than scramble to fix small bugs. I also wish they would work with modders to help improve the game, theres a lot of passionate and skilled people already putting out much needed quality of life and operational improvements but they often get wiped out by a hot fix or deliberately blocked. \n\nAs an aside there are some excellent mods out there and I look forward to them getting even better. \n\nAll in all I can actually recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good story and fun game.",

Despite all that I was rather excited to still play. The game is obviously buggy, and it should not be forgiven that the game was rushed out. But I experienced a minimal amount of bugs in my play-through. Now this game does a lot of good things, but very few great things. First, the soundtrack is amazing. It's not even the big names they had contribute that made the OST great. It's the smaller songs that played on the in-game radio. Absolute banger. Secondly the side stories. One of which is the story for Judy Alvarez. An amazing character with depth, and emotions. I found that the side stories were far more intriguing than the actual campaign story-line. Don't get me wrong, I loved the character development of Johnny Silverhand. But the immersion was broken while doing some quests. Over time you both form a bond. But some quests he's just an edgy butt-head to you for no reason. Other than that, combat felt meh. Melee seems very underpowered. The police are crazy and spawn everywhere and anywhere. My recommendation for this game, is to wait for all of the patches, and/or some DLC. I felt it was worth the full price, but to others probably not.",

        "content": "Wow. Quite some game. VERY mixed things to say here.\n\n\n\nFirst, the Positive Stuff:\nThis game is awesome! I love the city, the people running around, the ambience. Unbeatable. Whoever made this city come to life: this is astoundingly awesome work!\nThe gameplay is surprising. First it feels a bit sturdy. Wait until you unlock a few leves in Athletics.\nHacking also seems weak and rather obstructive. Wait until you put some levels into Intelligence.\nMost characters you encounter are really cool, stick to their agenda, no weird stupid-acting shit.\nDriving your vehicles is also an awesome feeling. Bike handling could be better, sharp turns and braking is odd.\nLots of missions really capture you, make you play slowly, enjoy the stuff.\n\n\n\nThe Mixed Stuff:\nIt takes quite a while until you get to the interesting part of the campaign. Around 5-10 hours. Most of my friends quit before that, or it took them weeks to pick it up again. These first hours the game really feels a bit railroady and as if you didn't have much choices. BUT: you actually do. You can have about 15 hours of free play before you enter the campaign missions that get you from \"Act 1\" to \"Act 2\". Basically there are no real Acts, because it's only those 2 and the last few railroad-missions at the end of the campaign, \"Act 3\". In Act 1 you're limited to one of ~7 regions, in Act 2 you can access them all, and Act 3 railoads you through the final missions. Afterwards (\"Act 4\") is after-campaign-freeplay, just like Act 2.\nBut after those 5-10 initial hours, the game and campaign become GREAT. Made me play 120 hours in 2 weeks.\nGunplay also gets more interesting with level, blades also. Balancing of difficulty levels is a bit strange.\n\nThe Bad Stuff:\nFirst thing that hit me: the menus, inventory etc is QUITE a pain in the ass. It is hindering in so many occasions.\nFirst off, exactly those keybindings that are needed most (access inventory, skills) do not exist, while others are plentiful.\nWhen you scroll halfway down lists and then remove/sell/scrap items, the list rows start jumping, so you cannot click quickly but have to check before each click. Funniest thing: lines do no jump when on line is emptied, but when only one item is left in that line.\n\nFurthermore, item sorting does not really work. In most cases, sorting is simply ignored. Sorting categories are missing. Sorting is mostly NOT saved, so you have to set those filters each time you access your inventory. BUT: sorting of trader inventories is saved. The thing you need least, it works. Still, also here some sorting categories are simply ignored.\nWorst of all is that the game tends(tended) to sort items by DPS. Damage per Second. The least interesting stat. \"Why least interesting?\" you might ask. Because DPS calculations are entirely wrong. Crits and DoT effects are (literally) a 1000 times more meaningful.\n\nAlmost the worst \"feature\" of the inventory is that you cannot lock unique/favorite items. With one of the later patches (1.12 maybe) the game at least asks you if you are sure you wanna sell items you have currently equipped. Other than that, it is highly likely you will sell/scrap a few meaningful guns in the game. In a game where there's only a few items that are really interesting...\nIn addition to that, the UI makes it quite hard to quickly deconstruct/sell unwanted items, even though after the campaign you will have done that 5000-10000 times...\n\nThe crafting/upgrading feature is also a disaster. Each time you upgrade an item, it takes more and more resources. Up to ridiculous numbers. You CANNOT change the painting on weapons. When you want to craft epic armor, you're also fucked. Those few items you can craft at max rank all look quite shite. You cannot set any cosmetics. Event tho you're level 20 master crafter. Worst feature here is: there are certain items you can craft (as often as you like, only limited by your resources), but those items count as quest items, so you cannot remove the from your inventory. Plus they have weight, eventually and ultimately slowing you down.\n\nWORST \"feature\" I've seen in a video game in the last 15 years: how the game handles mods. The inventory indicates that mods stack. Especially on clothes you get crazy numbers. Displayed. BUT: most clothing mods actually (those with %) do NOT stack (note: most mods with absolute numbers DO stack). Having more than one of those mods on ANY worn piece of gear is a waste. . So even if you had the same mod installed 15 times, only one would count. \nNow the worst part: if you remove a piece of armor with a certain mod, your mod bonus drops to 0, as if you had NO mods of that type equipped. You have to de-/ and re-equip at least one of those mods to get the bonus again.\n\nAnother bad feature is for example your email/messaging UI. Whatever you do on the right side (conversations), the left side (contacts/messages overview) will rarely get updated. So if there's a 'reply' tag on the message, you click that message, and reply, the 'reply' tag will not go away, until you exit the messaging UI and re-open it.\nSometimes when clicking through attachments etc the view will get stuck/broken, displaying the wrong items, not changing categories. Close and re-open inventory to fix it.\n\nAnother shit \"feature\" is an old remnant from the Witcher games. The more items you have in you inventory, the slower it gets. Like REALLY slow. Same stupid programmer that already fucked up the Witcher inventories with his mindless stupidity. I don't know what is wrong with people like those. And in 5 years, it has not gotten better. Why?\n\nAnother bad thing: looting gets really boring. There's like a million object in the game that you can loot, but they're quite worthless. Same with exploring. You can find a lot of cool stuff while exploring. In obvious places. But a LOTS of cool items can only be reached by exploiting severe bugs, and in location you could never imagine. So there's a bit of exploration that is fun, and the rest you have to follow YT videos. Not as fun as Skyrim, where there were lots of not-so-obvious but realistic locations you could find (without exploiting).\n\nAnd one thing that also pissed me off: after finishing the campaign, there's no chance of deactivating the mission marker for the final (campaign) mission, even tho you completed it (even all endings)... So that marker always hangs around, whatever you do.\n\nAnd finally, the saddest fact: once you completed all side missions and alerts, there's hardly anything left to shoot at. Some enemies respawn almost immediately (go away 50-100 meters, come back, they're there again), while in the more interesting locations enemies will not respawn until 24-48 hours later in game... So in the end (after ~100 hours) there's NOTHING left to be done.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nSo we see that gameplay and worldbuilding and most of the storytelling were done by amazing people. \nAnd then there was the team that made the inventory and equipment logic...\nI don't know what's going on at CDPR, but it's time they kicked out a few guys head over heels. Even just to make space and stop the idiots bother the geniuses.\n\nCyberpunk desperately needs some updates. A lot of is shortcomings are very easy to fix. Hope that the DLCs bring some lasting fun. The game could earn that easily. But looking at some of the devs, I got serious doubts that it actually will happen.\n\nMake Night City great again!",

        "content": "This is/was another game that we all fell for, and were sadly disappointed with. We were sheep to those knowing we wanted a game that goes beyond what we had previously experienced for a open world RPG. And from a PC perspective, this game was sad from launch. Bugs and glitches mad the game unenjoyable, removing any ounce of immersion before the first patch was even out. \n\nI ran the campaign in under 30 hours. Story was your typical small fish guy makes it big and goes hard on a common enemy. Your best part of the game is before it even actually starts, and then its a shit slide down hill from there. After beating the final boss and being sent back to a previous point, its kinda over honestly for replayability. After all that there was honestly no point to returning. The game sits you at a \"you cant go back beyond this point\" mission, and makes anything before seem out of place. Why they didnt do a after-play where things were more relevant, is beyond me.  \n\nDo yourself and your wallet a favor. Wait for a 75% sale or for it to go free on some platform. ITs not worth its  price tag, even after the updates. Dont let anyone else fool you otherwise.",

It's almost a perfect portrayal of the theme of corporate greed shown within the game. I do not however feel like I got less than I paid for and I'm hopeful CDPR will improve on what they've got here.\n\nIf you liked Fallout: New Vegas with all it's jank at release, and you have some serious hardware to turn up all the graphics (it sucks at the low end, no joke) you should find plenty to like in Cyberpunk 2077. Otherwise just wait for a sale with all the (inevitable) DLC at a fat discount.",

Hoping that the game was gonna start getting better as far as plot and feel. The part where the game gets better never came. I realized i wasnt getting there when i had almost finished the game. So i decided to stop maybe give the game some time to update and all that. \n LET ME TELL YOU !!

How the hell does Far Cry 2 AND 3 from 2008/2012 have better animations and shooting mechanics then a current gen game. It's been said a million times but this game is underbaked by at least like 2-3 years of what they actually planned it to be. CDPR is a horrible company and the only thing keeping them relevant are the redditors who worship Witcher 3 and the terrible sfm porn of the two atrocious woman you can have epic video game sex with. The damage has been done and you should not support them going forward.\n\n2021 Steam Awards Review Update: \n\nI'll say it once and I'll say it again, the only good thing to come out of this game is the soundtrack.",

        "content": "I deleted my original negative review because I wanted to give the devs more time to work out some of the bugs that had annoyed me during my first play through attempt last year. I had been waiting for a sign that the time was right to try again, the release of Edgerunners seems to have been that sign.\n\nAll of the bugs that had been so frustrating for me have been resolved for the most part. Occasionally something wonky happens but it can usually be fixed by either saving and reloading or saving and restarting the game. It's not super common and compared to the annoyance of trying to play something as buggy as a heavily modded New Vegas...well, patience can be learned.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from this play through is that V might be my favorite protagonist since Shephard in the Mass Effect trilogy. Same goes for the other characters. I liked the story before, liked the characters, but without some of the bugs to distract me and having a better idea of how to play the game, plus the impact of Edgerunners, this game has well and truly surpassed my expectations.\n\nAfter Fallout 4's voiced protagonist I was a little skeptical another first person RPG with a similar story. I wanted to play my character, not someone else's version of my character. Thing is, this is V's story; I'm along for the ride like Johnny (albeit with more control over how things play out). I don't feel like I'm V, I feel like I'm going through their story with them. It really hits a lot harder than it did before, and I'm the sappy goofball who got a bit weepy when a certain character died near the start of the game the first time. Been even more impactful this time.\n\nThe person who recommended it to me said this is the next Skyrim, in the sense that you can play it endlessly and it's mod friendly. If anything he's undersold it because the story is much better than anything put out by Bethesda. What happened at launch was tragic, but the devs have gone beyond redemption with this. Yeah, preorders are still a bad idea, yeah, corporate shenanigans led to the game being pushed out before it was ready and there are no doubt countless lessons to learn from this game's development.\n\nBut the biggest one is that sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. The faith the players had that the game would be amazing and worth their time. The faith the devs had their audience would \"get\" what they were trying to do here and would grow to love this game.\n\nI highly recommend this game.",

        "content": "Game's fine, at least I'm enjoying it although let's be honest, this game had little chance after so much hype. That said, it sat in my library and I did not actually download it until Feb 3rd as I waited for some patches.\n\nI have played far worse games and far buggier games. This is well done imo and I have not ran into any real glitches and maybe 2 or 3 very minor ones in over 100 hours of play.\n\nI have a decent rig but not a NASA level pc, i7-8700 and an RTX2070 but I'm sure this game runs less favorably with a lesser rig as it is a 2021 game with some decent technology.\n\nReviews in general don't always tell the story. I do read them and write a few on products in general including games but I find some people complain regardless. I would have missed out on some good products over the years if I strictly went by reviews. Tastes are different and so are mindsets and temperaments.\n\nThat said I noticed a campaign of sorts by those who hate this game to actually bring the overall rating of this game down. Yes some in the forums have been pushing for bad reviews. Enjoy the game and if it's not for you move on, or vent and move on. But don't bust on other people who like the game just because you don't like the game. When you do that I can't take your original opinion with any degree of seriousness.\n\nEdit: 1 more thing. The are countless \"Let's Play\" videos or quest walkthroughs and how to videos on the web. You'll see that the game runs just fine. And I am enjoying this game. Btw, it is an action Adventure with some RPG elements.\n\n2nd update: So 190 hrs in and I have to say this game is fun and has been running very well for me. No freezes, no crashes, no issues completing missing, no issues with achievements (if that's your thing) although I'm not really an achievement hunter. The game looks amazing.\n\nThe game might not be equal to all the hype but not many if any could hurdle the bar that was set for this game. Make no mistake it's a good game if Action Adventure games with some RPG elements are your thing. I give it a 7 1/2 out of 10 on PC but on console forget it from what I've seen and heard. More patches coming for both. Enjoy, I know I am.\n\n3rd Update. Finished the game on two different endings and I have to say there is much I really like about this game. Really took my time exploring this game plus I focused heavy on crafting and that can be time consuming if you let it be which I did. \n\nFortunately when you get to the point of no return the game auto pauses and let's you know while also autosaving at that point then will throw you back there after you beat the game if you say yes to that option which I did. \n\nI love the Crafting, the weapons, the gameplay fighting mechanics, and of course the story. You can really get attached to some of the characters.\n\nAs far as glitches go nothing really stopped me from completing the game and although I am not an Achievement hunter I don't feel like I was glitched out of any except maybe one but I can't say for sure as in the beginning before I really had a grasp for the game I messed up a side job and that job cost me 1 achievement.\n\nThis game is worth buying, but if you have a potato for a computer I would hold off until more patches come out and then make sure you meet the min requirements of course. Oh, I am also now modding a second character (playthru) with Nexus mods and they have many many mods already including a couple of game fix mods but I did not use mods on my first playthru.\n\nI'm revising my overall score on this game of which I am so glad I played to an 8 although I'm tempted to go 8 1/2. I'll be playing more characters as time goes on.",

If you expect that, and if you're gonna nitpick everything, this game is horrible for you. You'll hate the never-constructed train system, the cars that bug out, the naked T on the bike, enemies appearing out of nowhere behind you, etc.\n\nWhat it is: Gorgeous, rich story and characters that make you care. I'm getting old, I already expect a lot from games, and I expect them to be fun out of the box without a lot of input from me. But this game actually delivered that. It was fun from the very start.",

Sure there could have been more dialog choices in some of the missions, but they did a great job. Voice acting and music is fantastic. I hope they will add DLCs in the future.

So far Both melee and ranged combat are very fun to me and have me going around town starting trouble. The City is ridiculously immersive. You could literally just enjoy walking around and looking at signs and cars and conversations going on in game if you wanted. And last I really appreciate the music, they have some songs that really get you into the ambiance of the game. I was one of the lucky people that didn't have any bug issues and hopefully by now they have fixed all that with the console versions. My only complaint is that the hardest difficulty wasn't that hard at all, they should add another difficulty and reward you with a kick ass vehicle, clothing or weapon. Its fun to take screen shots in this game so how cool would that be to have the gear only obtainable by beating or unlocking the hardest difficulty, to show off to your friends in the Cyberpunk community? :D\nhttps://youtu.be/G1xsnddXJNk",

Story-line was cool but this is absolutely not an RPG outside of the leveling system which has promise but a lot of perks just don't work and the game kind of shoehorns a certain play style anyway so good luck trying to actually role-play the way you want to. I wouldn't recommend this game for even 50% off at its current state. Largely disappointing but am hopeful that they can turn this around to make me a fan I want to be.",

The world-building, storytelling, characters, and expansive lore to be found exploring Night City are some of the best I've ever seen in a video game, and I simply cannot get enough, even on a third playthrough.\n\nYou may have heard that Cyberpunk has bugs, dumb enemy AI, and technical issues.  These issues do exist, and Cyberpunk was released sooner than it should have been, making it truly a flawed gem in my eyes.  However, a gem is still a gem, and despite all of these problems being present, the core of this game is a treasure, especially if you are a fan of the Cyberpunk genre.\n\nIf bugs and technical issues can make or break a game for you, then I would suggest waiting a while and giving Cyberpunk a shot when it's in a more polished state.  But if some jank and occasionally hilarious glitches haven't ruined the core experience of a game for you before, then I can't recommend Cyberpunk 2077 enough, and I'm starving to see more of this franchise in the future.\n\nEdit:  Still love it.  No regrets.",

        "content": "An absolutely phenomenal experience. When I first played this game I went in to it not being hyped out of my mind, but being hyped, and I left being certain I just played one of the best games I had ever played. This game does atmosphere better than any other game. There's so many different situations you can be in, from a sunny beach house, a dimly lit hotel room, a parade and everything feels so good and like you are actually there. The voice acting in this game is probably the best I have ever heard, the story is so, so incredible. The story had me laughing, crying, celebrating, yelling, it's one hell of a ride which is complimented by the games characters. The characters are so well fleshed out and all feel like real people that you truly do care about and want to be around. A big part of that is the games facial and body animations on characters during dialogue is the best I have ever seen. Even Night City is probably the best looking open world/city I have ever seen in a game. I haven't seen a game capture the density of a real city as much as this game has. The music as well, the music is one of the best parts of the entire game, the games score is incredible and the original songs played over the radio capture the feeling of Night City perfectly and are also just great songs to listen to when not playing the game.  \n\nThe gameplay in Cyberpunk 2077 is also incredibly fun with the variety of ways you can go about it. Sniping from a distance, close quarters with smgs and pistols, melee weapons, hacking, stealth, guns blazing, not using weapons at all, being non-lethal, being overly lethal, it's all there and it's all great. On the topic of gameplay, this game does decision making through gameplay that I believe a lot of plays miss out on and it's done so well. During quests when tasked with taking out an NPC, even though the game doesn't tell you this at all, you can chose to kill them or just knock the out, and the quests dialogue will change depending on what you do, you can chose to do some steps of quests out of order and the quest NPCs will respond according, you can chose to kill NPCs involved in quests even if the game never asks you to and there will be dialogue about it later in the quest. I absolutely love how not ALL decisions in this game are through dialogue options and not ALL decisions are just put right up in your face like \"do this OR this! Make your decision right now!\"\n\nAnd of course, I'm not going to pretend the game is bug free, it's not, but it's not nearly as bad as some people were making it out to be. I played this game from release day until I had 100%'d the game twice in a row. Another game I had played on release day was Fallout: New Vegas and that game was WAY more buggy than Cyberpunk has ever been at any state post-release. Fallout: New Vegas is still the only game I had to put down and come back to at a later date because it was so buggy I could not enjoy it. Now fast forward to today and look at how Fallout: New Vegas is looked at, people treat it like it's one of the greatest games that has ever graced us. Obviously that is because (even though people don't want to admit it) people had hyped Cyberpunk 2077 WAY beyond what CD Projekt RED did and thought the game was going to come out and be twice as big and 10 times as good as anything anyone had ever played before, which was never going to happen, obviously. I see people constantly saying \"CD Projekt RED did this to themselves by hyping it up way too much\". CDPR didn't hyped this game up that much more than any developer hypes their own game up, they just went along with the overhype the fans did to themselves, because as a developer, why wouldn't you. The amount of times I have seen someone say that \"CDPR hyped it up too much by promising............\" and then immediately saying something that CDPR had never promised and was something the fans themselves had made up was going to be in the game is insane.\n\nBut, all in all, as someone who plays A LOT of singleplayer games and doesn't take games being in my top of all time lightly. Cyberpunk 2077 has EASILY shot itself into my top 5 games, possibly top 3 I have ever played. It was, in my opinion, the best game to come out in 2020 no contest. The game IS buggy, but no more buggy than your average Bethesda game, with the developers actively fixing it and bettering it. I truly believe that once CDPR has the game in a state they are proud of this game will be remembered as one of the best ever released. I truly, truly, sincerely, pity anybody who has bought into the YouTuber circlejerk of hating on this game because it gets them viewers and is going to miss out on this game, because it is one that should not be missed.",

Buy this to experience the story and atmosphere. Game has a lot of potential. I suggest to wait fro a few more patch notes If you care about the game being fully optimized and polished.",

And the great times I've had slaying, lying, and sleuthing my way through its charming sci-fi world got me wondering why it took so long for this sort of game to catch on. There are still a few technical hitches to be worked out, just like the fussy engines on the Skeld, but that hasn't kept me from coming back to it again and again in my down time.\n\n",

        "content": "I love this game. Played on an old Xbox One S. Pretty buggy but didn't expect too much considering it was the older console. Still had fun and loved the 60 hours i put into it. Thinking it should have been a next gen only game. \n\nAnyway... Built my PC and played it again. Much better experience! Graphics where amazing and game was less buggy.  Obviously the game still needs a lot more work and I'm happy to watch it grow, instead of spitting venom towards the developers. In my opinion the story was worth the money.  Much better than any game I've played recently. \n\nThat being said my main gripes are the dull NPCs. Think they could have went with quality over quantity. Less NPCs with better AI and character.  Random exploding cars scare the sh*t out of me with headphones in lol. Re-skined guns was a bit of a let down.  Hopefully they change that or add more guns with uniqueness.  Maybe the skill tree needs hacked down a tad. Some of it was bugged or useless. \n\nGood to be able to use mods for the game to have extra fun and character customisation. This should be base CDPR!!\n\nCant wait for multiplayer as the game is pretty much worn out after third play through and roughly 300 hours. \n\nGive the game more time to cook as CDPR seem to be having it bad and the game really helped me through Lock down. Should have been released as beta or something. \n\nDo not buy this game expecting GTA 6.  Its not GTA its something unique in itself. \n\nGood luck to all the staff and developers for he future of this game. A few more years and a lot can be done with this game.",

The problem is that is was weighed down with too much ambition and mismanagement.  The story won't blow you off your feet, the gameplay isn't revolutionary by any means, and the world it's self, while stunning at first, just seems like a wall of grey as you drive by similar looking buildings that have little to no significant value, but I've had fun playing it despite all of this.  All in all, I would recommend this game if you're a fan of RPGs or open worlds with lots of lore.  I can not recommend spending full price for this game however.  If I had to buy it again, I would wait until it was on sale or the price dropped quite a bit.  Just don't set your standards too high like most people (including me) did.",

Not as good as they hyped it up to be, but I genuinely enjoy this game now. There are still a few bugs hanging around but its not really that noticeable. \n\nHonestly, what an epic comeback this game has. \n7/10",

The Silverhand scenes are some of the most BA scenes in a game. 7.5/10\n\nWeapons: Mantis blades and revolvers are super fun to use. 8/10\n\nCrafting: Make sure you hold onto some iconic weapons, as you can craft them into some insanely OP weapons late game. Other than that I don't think I ever crafted anything else and crafting seems mostly useless. 5/10\n\nVehicles: Don't even bother with cars the driving is awful, just use motorcycles or fast travel 3/10\n\nMusic: Fits the game well and does add a lot to it. 9/10\n\nBugs: As of 1.12 there are still a ton of bugs, however most of them are pretty funny and non game breaking. The bug where you randomly drop dead for no reason is annoying, and then when the game crashes is also annoying because it will take steam 30 years to realize the game has crashed and is no longer running. 5/10\n\nPerks/ Upgrades: With a game that has this many perks and upgrades, why can't I max out my character and be able to unlock all perks? Most of them are pretty useless, but with a Lvl cap of 50 you can only get about 25-30% of perks I'd say. 3/10\n\nKeanu Reeves: It's Keanu Reeves. 100/10\n\nSide Quests: Some of the side quests can feel a bit grindy, but as a whole I definitely recommend doing the side missions and not just sticking to the story only, as they add quite a lot to the experience. 7/10\n\nOverall I'd rate this game a solid 7/10 if you don't take it too seriously. If you were apart of the hype and were expecting the savior of the gaming industry then I wouldn't recommend this game for you.",

Yes it looks gorgeous, yes some of the characters are so memorable, but there are clearly glaring issues and a lack of closure for some quests or characters.  You cannot allow management to sell something that's not done, listen to the developers and the people who make the real technical contribution to the crafting of the game or cultivate a professional environment where people don't feel like they cannot articulate if something isn't done or won't be finished on time.",

This game is one of the best 2020 games that was 90% completed. \n                I definitely recommend this game, because of the story, and the relationships you build with the characters. Panam is my wifu for the remainder of my life.\n                Of course there are bugs and glitches, but come on guys, Red Dead Redemption had bugs and even game crashes, but you don't see it get butchered lol\n                 Try out the game, and believe me this game is up there with Fallout 4, and Elder Scrolls.",

So I don't really regret the money spent.\n\nThat said, as the multitudes have said, Cyberpunk 2077 comes with a trainload of weird bugs a glitches that span from the mealy amusing, all the way up to obnoxious.  For me none were truly game-breaking, and a quick reload from a save fixed most.  If that sounds to  tedious than wait for fixes.\n\nAs for gameplay,, it's a mixed bag as well.  The gameplay loop is entertaining, and the sound is ok.  Graphically, the textures seemed a little mushy for how much hype there was, though I was playing on a 1080p 120hz display. As for the story elements, I enjoyed it for the most part , but wasn't exactly wowed at any point.",

        "content": "Ok, so yeah I have some graphical glitches, but that's where my complaints end.\n\nThis game is incredible, truly a masterpiece. Every detail of the game pulls you into its dystopic atmosphere. You can do anything be anything and only you can make your dreams come true.\n\nI've played a lot of games that made you feel like nothing in a world that doesn't care whether you exist. Cyberpunk is all about that. It's not like some other games where you kill one boss and everybody likes you/ fears you. You start as nothing, your entire goal is to make a dent, make your own legacy.\n\nThe story is extremely heavy handed and it doesn't go out of its way to be nice to you. It tells you the stakes pretty early on and makes it clear what you're supposed to do about it.\n\nBack to the atmosphere. Yes the world is gritty, dirty, depressing and bleeding with satire. Every block, every store front, every vending machine, just pulls you into a living world that really doesn't give a living howdy-do about you and that's great cause you get to be a complete jerk and feel justified doing it.\n\nThe conversations are in depth and its obvious mo-cap was used. Characters move, sit down, get up, wave their arms around. One conversation, you're sitting at a food stand with some meatballs sitting in front of you. You can choose to respond to the conversation, or simply take another bite of your food, then answer. The game makes it quite clear that your answers carry weight, and more often then not, those answers are completely ambiguous. \n\nI can't overstate this, you are not the good guy. You are not the savior of Night City. Then again, you aren't the bad guy either. Things such as law and morals are completely up to you. Even the cops are on the payroll. Heck, even you are on the payroll.\n\nCombat is visceral, violent, and smooth as stainless steel. Your punches carry weight, your katana is quick and lethal, your sniper rifle is accurate and your assault rifle feels just as good as any(pick your favorite) fps should. I recommend a controller for driving, because the physics are there but are more akin to GTA or NFS. And you can buy cars with all the money you got from wiping out gang members or cops or whatever suits you. \n\nCyberpunk makes no apologies about what it is. This is not a happy world, you are not a knight in shining armor. This is edgy, graphic, violent and unapologetic. Oh and Keanu.",

I felt intrigued to see it to the end, and it was good. \n\nI ran it with I5, nvidia 1080 and 16gb gb ram and it went smoothly for the most part except for some FPs drop in the city when driving at high speed, but o be fair the city had a lot of details. Had a few crashes but nothing game breaking for me, and the bugs were mostly just hilarious. \n\nOverall good game, maybe wait for a few more patches but it has a feel of fallout combined with borderlands.\nAnd not to forget that Keanu Reeves is simply just awesome, really liked the ''duality'' here :)",

This feeling will follow you always and everywhere, except prologue and epilogue. Unfortunately, the open world of cyberpunk lacks a sense of believability, logic, common sense and predictable response. Night City is like trying to be alive, but still have not enough forces for it. Strange physics and ballistics in this sense, pushes the desire to explore the world and go deeper inside this beautiful city. It is also a very weak/poor RPG component, without deep relationships with the outside world and without reaction to your different actions, without variety of bosses.\n\nThe review will be RED, because I want to make it clear to all of you, and most importantly to game developers, that the open world should not be like this. I hope you agree with me a lot. But still, the game has many positive aspects such as music, plot, elaboration of the main characters and, of course, future design and architecture of cyberpunk city, about the city, we can still see how much work has been done in this direction.\n\nDisappointed!\nI'll be back in the game in a year or two for new DLC's, hoping to see a new living world.\n6 Johnny of 10",

One of the biggest problems I had with the PS4 version were the atrocious load times. I have been playing Cyberpunk on my Shadow (remote gaming PC service) which has an SSD (Solid State Drive for the none nerds) and load times were ridiculously fast. \nWhat the developers should have done is release the PC version then work on the console versions for a few months until they were playable.

It\u2019s sad that the PC version is a great game, but because the console versions were sh*t, the game in its entirety suffered. \nBottom line, buy the damn game!",

This tech demo is a pretty great prototype of what a game would look like on this engine though.\n\nDon't bother buying it thinking they will fix it either. This game has the same amount of people playing it daily as an 8 year old survival early access title, 7 Days to Die. They are not going to invest much into this, and will be looking to move onto the ray tracing update The Witcher 3 is receiving. I think most people would rather see that anyway.",

Find it better than other releases of this type,  but I am quite biased towards the dystopian future punk genera.  Never felt like this was a mistake to purchase.",

It's still buggy in places, but what can you really expect from a game that was released seriously early due to irate fans unable to be patient and wait for a properly finished version. They've made some patches which have fixed a lot of the major issues. But I find the story compelling, many of the characters well portrayed, and the world very solidly built. Plenty of fun little things to find and do, choices that do make a difference to how certain things play out. It's no Fable or Mass Effect in that regard (they made your decisions have real weight behind them even before the final missions) but it does a decent job of making you think about what you're going to do. Many choices are fairly inconsequential, only changing rewards or narrative from news stations based on who you chose to save or wipe out. But the gunplay is excellent. The options for character build are pretty good as well. Overall, tons of fun to play and I can't wait for some DLC releases once they get the main game properly polished.",

The story has been fantastic so far, the side quests very enjoyable too.  I've ended up feeling attached to the characters I've met, much like in the Witcher.  I did like Geralt as a protagonist but I'm happy CDPR let us create our own character this time.  I find the first person gameplay to be a strength here rather than a weakness, CDPR nailed the gunplay, it's more enjoyable to me than the 3rd person sword play of the Witcher series.  Overall I'm very happy with the game and I look forward to seeing what will come in the future through patches, DLCs and modding.  Night City is an amazing creation and milestone for PC gaming, it will only get better with time.",

        "content": "Yes, this game has some issues. The driving has no features and pursuits are nonexistent, glitches happen, frame rate suffers sometimes unless you have a decent computer. But I absolutely love this game. It is still a technological miracle. When I started playing, I literally could not stop because I felt like a kid playing video games for the first time again. The story and characters, very very well written and CDPR definitely understands what makes good science fiction. The premise seem pretty realistic for what the future will be like, and the stories and characters actually made me FEEL things. When I finished the main questline for the first time I couldnt think about anything else for the next few days. Truly memorable.\n\n I'm the type of person who loves to grind side content, and doing these missions and dicing people with a katana or ripping them apart with a shotgun (which im now doing on my second playthrough, 114 hours total) never got old for me. I didn't even touch the other skill trees involving hacking and stealth, and people who play that way seem to really like it as well. Earned \"eurodollars\" actually have a purpose in the game and earning money is incredibly satisfying. This is the type of game you can leave the main story, descend into night city for 60 hours and become a god-level badass before mission 2, and I really really appreciate that. \n\nFinally, the atmosphere and music. Even if you're not a huge hard rock or electronic fan, the combat music just fucking slaps. Fighting a base of enemies by yourself with that music seriously gives me serotonin. The setting is simply magical. It can be beautiful, gritty, weird, or all at the same time. And people, I know most of you dont care about this but the graphics are fantastic. Literally ive wasted so much time in photo mode dressing my character up in all these dope outfits and cool poses next to my nice ass cars. In summary, the game is not perfect. But for me personally, it's my favorite type of game made on a massive scale with incredible attention to detail (the vast majority of the time). Thank you for reading.",

        "content": "The game overall is excellent.  Its like walking around in a mix of the world of Blade Runner and Fifth Element.  Only much ruder and hyper-sexualized.  While I played in the early going the game was glitchy.  Seems especially weird with sound on my setup but I think that may be partially on my end with the way I have my audio running via ARC on an HDMI cable going into my AV receiver from a gaming laptop.  Should be noted that I am running this on PC and so have no opinion on how its going on consoles.  Otherwise, the game is very solid with 99% of the mechanics for me.  Driving takes a bit of getting used to and is fairly sensitive.  I found bikes to be easiest to deal with and the one that looks like the one from Akira is cool.  I guess it should also be noted that I'm a simple fella and prefer a controller over keyboard and mouse.  Its just way more natural for me and at this point I'm not likely to change.  So I have been playing this using the xbox elite controller wired to my gaming laptop.  Since all the xbox controllers in my life have decided they like to randomly disconnect a lot now.  That's at least three different controllers on a console and a laptop all losing BT connection repeatedly.  Straying from the point here.  Great game that is gorgeous and fun to play for hours without need of multi player.  Story has been engrossing too, so I have slow played it and burned through most of the side quests before fully finishing the main storyline.  Set it down for a couple of weeks but am back again for more.  You'll get your money's worth out of this one.",

If they fixed all the bugs i would thumbs up but suggest getting it on sale.\n\nTL:DR The game is buggy as hell and broken, if they fix all these issues it's worth getting on sale (50%) but is otherwise nothing special\n\nUPDATE: Even months on the bugs are still so common (for me) and their attempts at fixing them and fixing issues with the gameplay are not really noticable and could even be argued to be making things worse.",

        "content": "This game... for all its flaws, is pretty good. Can't stop playing it. So much social-economic-political commentary all wrapped around a dark slightly-noir cyberpunk world. Where murder, suicide, and manslaughter are the norm (let alone the mistreatment of ALL workers not just the sex workers, although they definitely get shafted far more often). With rampant capitalism in every aspect of society and constant destruction of the earth that has become so common place that nobody talks about it anymore. The two moments in the game where you are encouraged to take the message of change seriously are quickly unraveled. If your attempts at a change aren't straight up undermined or twisted in on itself by a selfish ally, then you're being trolled by someone who wants to make you believe otherwise. That leads me to my other thoughts on this game. It's beyond pessismistic and cynical. With everything in the game. To the point where... I wouldn't call it necessarily punk unless you choose a specific ending (those punksters out there will know it when they see it). The \"Punk\" in this game is the decisions within the game that you make. Those who choose not to slaughter every person they come across will probably know that.\n\nFinally let's talk about the elephant in the room, the reason why this game isn't going to be Game of the Year 2020 or something like that bs. Because of its release in such a horrible state for all platforms (consoles especially). This is relevant because it's ironic. The game itself wants you to hate Corpos and that worlds captialism in general (which I personally do despise) yet... The corpos who made this game did a lot of the same shit this game claims to be evil. Exploited their workers dedication through practices like crunch only to release this game long before it should have been released. Not to mention the fact that, unlike the game, there are instances of sexual harassment within the real life Corps (Though the Evelyn story line can show the outcome of that). Although I'm sure they're there in game, they are either not the main focus (background noise of the npcs complaining about something to make it seem more real) or just isn't there. \n\nIn conclusion the story of this game is subversion incarnate. Not just in the game but in the production leading up to its making, it's delays, it's failed promises, and even actual release. Cyberpunk 2077 in it's entirety is an example of Capital's greed both in universe and in production. That is what makes this game an accidental masterpiece to me. IF CDPRJKT Red just treated their workers well, hell if the workers just had a union or some kind of bargaining power, and if this game took it's development time instead of listening to the impatient masses who were going to complain regardless. It would have been beyond masterful. IT would have been legendary.\n\nAnd I think that's the real tragedy of this game. It's AAA game, just like any other. Sure story is great, combat's fun, characters are lively and entertaining, setting is awesome though dark, premise is fascinating, and it sometimes feels very natural. Like I am that character. But... seen these things a million times. Bethesda, Bioware, hell even the Witcher 3 (which I haven't personally played but heard \"good\" things about). And considering it's development cycle... it couldn't have turned out any more bog standard, despite it's accident of enhancing the view of capitalism's faults in it's many stories. \n\nTl:dr Buy this game... for sale. It's a masterpiece only in how it's design and story relates to it's production hell and terrible real life Corpos. Much like The Room. If it weren't for that symmetry it's just a pretty solid \"AAA\" video game to play when you're bored. Like Mass Effect or Skyrim or Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 were before it. Bugs, weird story decisions, sexual harassment, and worker exploitation through practices like crunch in all. First review so... Let's call it 7/10? Idk.",

I have to also comment on the replayability; I don't know what more I would be able to do after beating the main story line. like yeah I get some new equips but what else? I plan on replaying through the other storylines though just to see all the differences. I plan on recording them for youtube. I want to speak on that too. as a youtuber I love that I can play the game and record without worry about a copyright strike! every time I play gta or fallout I always get hit with something. and the censor nudie was a great idea too. Thank you very much.\n\none last thing. I want to comment on something one of the developers said in an interview;\n\nYou don't just say you're doing No Man's Sky.\n\nYou just do No Man's Sky. \n\n\n~Finn(onelifepillow)@ youtube",

There are a lot of little bugs.

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 - A hidden gem game.\n\nAfter finishing all the endings completely in my first play-through, I can safely say that the game is phenomenal. I have never felt genuinely connected to a game that I can relate to since Dragon Age: Origins. Yes, there are still some bugs and other technical issues that needs to be fixed over time (despite the many patches they had), but the content in the game is a pure masterpiece. \n\nThe characters, the story, and the music are the three aspects that makes Cyberpunk 2077 shines. Game-play and Graphics are overall good but pales in comparison to both the Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2. \n\nBugs in games are fairly common in the gaming industry. It was expected. So, I am fine with the technical issues in this game. My one and only biggest disappointment that I have for this game, however, is the lack of content as an 'Open World' genre. As a game explorer, I considered this as 'the worst' open world that I ever played. There is nothing to do except completing every main and side quests, gigs, and chasing down NCPD Hustle quests. Life-path seems redundant and an illusion as it does not provide any major changes, except with a few extra dialogues, to your in-game. There is no 'catching-up' with your NPC characters (romance or not) after you finish their quests, except repetitive dialogues (Thankfully, there is Judy's text messages after her romance, at least.) that you can grew bore over time (I will have to apply the mods to add the immersion in it, instead) . \n\nHence, I am feeling that this game is more like a 'semi-linear' genre rather than an 'open world' genre. If CD Project Red wants to create a better open world, they should follow other games' examples like Red Dead Redemption 2 and make a better comeback to this game towards its greatness.  \n\nAm I still replaying Cyberpunk 2077? \n\nHell, yeah. Because this game has the best NPC characters (Judy and Panam), music and story missions that I ever encountered in my gaming years. Also, we have the modding community to thank who are actually fixing and adding customization to the game more than the developers did which thus, making the game to what it is meant to be. Because of the modding community, I am able to have fun adding stuffs like hanging out with the characters (simping for Judy & Panam), taking amazing screenshots, and many more. \n\nAfter many patch updates, is it still worth buying Cyberpunk 2077? \n\nMy answer: \n\nAlthough that I love this game a lot (it is my current No.1 favorite game), and yes, I believe that I am one of the minority group that favors Cyberpunk 2077 more, but I highly recommend to buy it once the game is fully repaired which includes DLC expansions and bug fixes, and purchase it on sales, in order to achieve a full gaming experience. In its current state, I reckon this game requires at least 3 to 5 years or more in order to fix the game and most importantly, having CD Project Red to regain its trust from the people they lost. I may be late for the hype train before it's pre-launch previously, however, I completely understand the hate and mistrust for this game due to the manipulation via marketing tools that the developers had toward their people. Hopefully, this will be a lesson to everyone for both customers and the developers from this and improve better in the future. :)\n\nOverall, 8.5/10 rating for me!",

I honestly haven't seen many bugs in the game other than some missing assets and floating characters. CDPR is still actively working on fixing these bugs on top of hundreds of others and its clear that they are no where close to stopping their support and bug fixes in this game. I didn't think I would really like this game other than the graphics, but the more I played, the more I fell in love with this game. \n\nWhen I first played this game, my father was admitted into the hospital. I played Cyberpunk to try to distract from everything that was happening. It's sad to say that a month later my dad never came home. That being said, if I hadn't played Cyberpunk, I would be struggling a lot more. My first run through of the game allowed me to work through some very personal and tough decisions, both in the game, and in my own life. This game has a lot of tough decisions you have to choose and will possibly impact how you interact in the real world.\n\nIn short, should you buy it now? If you don't mind a few bugs, go ahead. But if you want a 'complete game' with little to no bugs, come back in a few months. The game is beautiful and bugs shouldn't define the quality of the game.",

You could easily loose track of time while loosing yourself in Night City and I think this game does not deserve a beating more than your average over sold game.\nI would say a 75/100 for a note, buy it if you're ready to take this game for what it is rather than what CD Projekt said it would be ;-)",

The narrative is hit and miss. Some of it is brilliant, there are several really cool and visually stunning vistas. I found the Nomad setting outside of Night City to be the most interesting, but your mileage may very well vary. Wait a year or two, and buy this game when it is on (a big) discount.",

The second you go off and try to explore the city without a quest guiding you it becomes painfully obvious the game was nowhere near completion. Whole sections of the city that are unused, broken AI, snore-worthy combat, hacking, apparently, but it's boring, vast, brutalist architectural wastelands scream of unused potential and scrapped ideas. The city is a ghost town, the desert is lifeless, the ghost towns are somehow just that, uninteresting ghost towns. The game is nothing but lifeless NPCs staring at you with their dead little eyes screaming their pre-programmed voice  lines at you before they de-spawn into the eternal void forever the second you turn your back to them. Meanwhile you click your mouse to fire the hilariously overpowered gun you found because the game has 0 balance in regards to combat, and an excessive skill tree that feels like it does next to nothing outside of extremely specific situations. \n\nIt's obvious the project managers weren't doing much project managing on this game. Over-hype ballooned expectations out of control, the devs crammed every last idea they had in there from nipple physics to hilariously terrible dialogue from an A list celebrity to try and live up to the hype. Like loading a wooden bridge with trucks filled with concrete... It's going to collapse at some point. \n\nDespite this, I still bought the game because it couldn't be that bad, right? And it wasn't... But it also wasn't good. It's just a solid \"meh.\" Toward the middle of the second act I got so bored that i uninstalled it. Nothing there was keeping my interest. I could ramble on, but I'm getting to the part of this review where, just like Cyberunk 2077, anything past the main points would turn this into incoherent rambling attempts at trying to reach an audience.",

        "content": "There are a lot of reviews for this game but I still thought that I'd give my own personal opinion and boy do I have a lot to say about this game.\n\nCP2077 has a great core. I was really intrigued once the first trailer came out and I was very excited for it to be released. The first person perspective is unique and I as many others hoped for a revolutionary open world RPG. So let me start with giving the game some praise. \n\nI'd lie if I said that there weren't at LEAST a couple of good things about this game. The music, the city, the characters, are all very well crafted and they only really clicked together since they were made BEFORE CDPR decided to throw it all in the dump and start from scratch. \n\nThe city is well thought out and feels hand-crafted instead of just a couple of messily bunched together tile sets and it's absolutely beautiful. However, it's probably just about the only compliment that I can give this game without feeling like I'm ignoring some kind of negative in this mess of a game. However, while it might be gorgeous to look at, the city is quite void of things to do. It might look jam-packed with content from a distance but when it actually comes down to exploring the city, it feels kind of dead despite bustling with neon lights, civilians, traffic etc, etc. With no activities like minigames and such, it's quite boring. The tall skyscrapers connected by a series of tunnels and bridges feel like they only serve as a tease of what we could've gotten since there is absolutely no real vertical element in the game. In the year that this game is set and with the technology that is all around NC, you would think that there would at least be a parachuting mechanic and some kind of climbing, yet there isn't. \n\nThe characters are generally also very interesting, yet I feel like the game is lacking in that aspect too. The only character I really found myself intrigued by was Judy, and that says a lot about the games other ones. I lack empathy for other characters that directly influence V because of how bland they were. Their side jobs became more of a chore than something I felt excited to do and I found myself skipping through most of the dialogue with them because I just didn't care. The romance option gives you four characters in total to try to build some kind of relationship with but I'd say that only one of them is worth spending your time with, but you also need to meet certain criteria for that to work out. I like the fact that these characters have a preference and that CDPR took time to really try to bring that aspect out, yet I also felt like I was missing out since the romance options for a male V are absolutely terrible. Besides that, the game seems to really want to push that PG18 title so most of these supposedly relationships only feel like a one night stand since you can't really do much other than that.\n\nThe AI system is horrendous and some of the NPC's are outright terrifying. As soon as you commit any type of crime, cops spawn around you which isn't only bad design, it feels cheap and unrealistic. To lose the cops all you have to do is run or drive down the street in a single straight line and they'll lose your trail in mere seconds, no matter what difficulty level or wanted level. No police chase, nothing. You would've thought that they'd at least put some kind of backup in front of you but the game lacks that as well. The games cars only really serves as a purpose to give speed junkies as myself some thrill when driving but that's about it since you won't really experience any kind of NCPD chase. I also found out that jumping into a body of water confuses the police so badly that they instantly lose track and you're off the hook. Comparing this to GTA which came out years ago, it's an extreme letdown. Now to the NPC's that walk the streets of NC, I feel like the only purpose they serve is to try to make the city feel more alive, yet I find it struggling with that as well. The kids strolling around are creepy and they walk around completely alone without the presence of a guardian. Their voices don't match their supposed ages and it's very unrealistic. Don't even get me started on all the traffic in NC. Sure, a city this size must have a LOT of traffic, that's no surprise, but the amount of times I've accidentally totalled my car because some dingus decided to suddenly create traffic jam is uncountable. \n\nThe game's system for building your character around your own preferred play-style is an interesting concept, yet that is also horribly executed. Even when focusing on the stealthily perks I still found that the most effective method for any kind of gig or side job was running and gunning the whole place. The ability to throw knives to stealthily take out a target sounds interesting at first but it's not as effective as it seems since you lose your knives after only one throw. I've never been much of a stealth focused person but most of the times I try it, things work out. This wasn't the case for CP2077. I've lost count of amount of times I've been detected for some unknown reason or by enemies with vision that allows them to see through walls, and I feel extremely sorry for the people that favours stealth.\n\nThe gigs and side jobs lack in so much content that I get bored easily and most of them feel like things I have to do instead of want to do for fun. \n\nAlso, the whole Johnny Silverhand thing feels to me like the devs trying to force Keanu Reeves into a role that doesn't even fit him because of the time crunch and tight deadlines. \n\nNow this is without mentioning all the games glitches and bugs that have driven me crazy. The texture pop-ins of trees, t-posing NPCs, sudden cars just spawning in and exploding, NPCs from gigs that I played (and failed) early on in the story still following me in the late game, objectives not being fulfilled because of some weird glitch despite me making sure multiple times that I've done exactly like the game wants me to, glitches that involve me not being able to pick up weapons. These aren't even all of them and they've happened so many times that I've almost given up entirely. \n\nEven if the game started to suddenly work properly, there are too much missing content and too many holes in the game for me to call it a good game. The 60 euro price tag really doesn't reflect the games quality at all. Overall, the game is a letdown to all the hype it built up and considering the amount of people that worked on this, I just can't call it good. You're honestly just better off spending the 60 euros on something else because this game is disappointing and not worth the money.\n",

I eventually just turned off subtitles because of how buggy it was. THE FUCKING TREES. I FUCKING HATE THESE TREES. The trees are constantly loading over top of buildings, so even though a tree is behind a building it will appear in front of it and look like a shit png was photoshopped on top of it. They are also constantly flashing in and out and just make the whole experience ass. I was going to try and finish a couple of the side missions, but the trees really fucked my vibe.

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 94.2 hours clocked in. \n(SPOILER-FREE)\n\nBefore I say anything, let me get this out of the way. You will not play this game without encountering some kind of glitch or bug. Expect to see someone pop out of existence, float in midair, or spontaneously combust every once in a while. If this is a deal-breaker for you, do not buy this game. Even more so, if you are a completionist and looking to 100% this game, I cannot stress enough do NOT buy this game. There are multiple side quests I was unable to complete (a main quest being one of them, though it decided to work one day for some reason) due to the fixer never calling you, or characters texting me about how I didn't finish the mission when they had just thanked me for completing it 2 minutes earlier. 100% this game will likely require you to restart a quest a few times, or spend hours just hoping it works this time, if this is a deal-breaker for you, do not buy this game. Now, with that out of the way, if you're a casual gamer that is willing to look past or even have a good laugh at the common place bugs, and don't care whether or not you miss a quest or two, please continue. \n\nCombat: This game is first and foremost an rpg. Head-shots will not auto kill like in other FPS, and shooting at the enemy's legs or arms won't slow them down. The enemies are essentially sponges until their health drops to zero. The only real variety between enemies is their death animation. If you use a sword or sharp weapon there's a chance for their head's to come off, if you use a strong enough gun you can blow their heads clean off, and if you use some kind of explosive they'll blow to bits. Admittedly, seeing this happen is badass, but in reality its all icing and no substance. The enemies, besides some bosses, all act the same and because of this fighting can become boring or tedious. That leads into another gripe I have with this game, the armor and evasion stats feel almost non-existent. It doesn't matter how much armor you get, or how much evasion you rack up, you'll still die in the same three hits to the same enemy over and over again. There is no \"tank\" build, you're either all damage and hope you can kill your enemy before they get a shot in, or you sneak around and silently kill everyone before you're spotted. CDPR acts like there's a lot of variety in in your builds but it all comes down to these two tactics. However, the stealth missions in this game are really fun. The way you can hack the cameras to disable them or even look for enemies through its lens is really cool and its one of the game's high points. You can even get enemies to fight each other through a certain skill, and sneak by them while they're going at it. In short, though there may not be many \"builds\" so to speak this one aspect of the game gives a lot of variety. \n\nTLDR: Enemies are like sponges, doesn't matter where you shoot them they die all the same, dont expect an enemy to limp after you shoot them in the leg, they'll still run a marathon.\n\nCars/vehicles: The driving as other people have mentioned feels like you're on ice. Its almost impossible to make a turn with any care if you're going more than 80 mph. There are really cool and fast cars I couldn't use because I'd always end up crashing and blowing my car up or getting chased by the cops after hitting a family of four at 200 mph. The motorcycles are a lot more tolerable, but it can still be annoying at times. Because of this, I found myself using the game's teleporters more often than not which is really disappointing. The game is beautiful, and driving around, especially at night was amazing, it just isn't practical if you're actually trying to get somewhere. The fact that you can't customize your car is also really lame but there are so many in this game it was easy to find one that fit my \"style\" so I can't complain too much.\n\nTLDR: This is not GTA 5 driving, it feels like you're driving on ice\n\nQuests: This is where the game shines. This is why you buy the game and are able to look past all its flaws, the missions in this game, although can tend to pile up, are without a doubt its greatest strong suit. Its almost like all the features and character arcs the devs couldn't implement/flesh out in the main storyline were done justice. You feel genuinely invested in the mission, you're given ACTUAL choices that affect how it ends (more on that later) and it gives you a chance to really care about the characters brushed aside in the main story. I don't want to give too much away, but one of my favorite side quests (I know I said spoiler free but this is one small side quest out of MANY that in no way ties to the main story, if you truly care skip past this) is one where you're tasked with saving a doctor. When you get there, guns blazing or however you want to do it, the doctor refuses to leave. Its revealed that she was kidnapped to save the life of a gang leader and will not come with you until she saves her patient. You can do a lot of things here, personally I helped her save the patient so I can end the job on good terms, but I recommend you look through all the options yourself. These kind of missions, the ones that make you question whether what you're doing is right, and compels you to load a save and try it again is what makes Cyberpunk so addicting at times. But again, the incredible characters lead into another complaint I have, dead-ends. Its really frustrating to be invested in a side quest only for it to end so abruptly. At times it feels unfinished and you almost feel like a side character in your own story, a character brushed aside/forgotten about when things really get juicy. But most quests don't feel like this, they feel truly fleshed out, its just very noticeable and hard to brush aside when it does happen. \n\nChoices: After a certain early mainline quest, there is almost no variety in the main story. No matter what you say, or how you do it, things will play out the exact same every time. The only real choice you have is whether or not to be a dick. Even the game's endings are pretty straightforward. When it comes down to it, you basically have three endings, and the extra four are just, again, variations of those three whether or not you were a dick. The E3 demo REALLY overplayed just how much control you have over your own story. But I will say, the endings are great, and you'll feel invested in whatever ending you choose.\n\nAlright, this might end a little abrupt but I feel like I got my main points across. Cyberpunk is a flawed game. It's glitched, tedious, and at times even frustrating; but if there's one thing CDPR did right, its made you give two shits about Night City. \n\nI recommend, at least after a few more patches, that you buy Cyberpunk 2077. \n\n3/5\n",

I originally got this on PS4 but quickly traded it in to get it on Steam.  I'm happy with my choice.\n\nLooking forward to a New Game + and some DLC to keep going back to try out different builds.  It does lack some replayability as the quests are pretty much the same.\n\nWould recommend to friends and strangers.",

All the hours i put in after that was just me trying to feel like i got my money's worth out of Cyberpunk for 60 dollars. First 30 hours in cyberpunk, are an artistic masterpiece. Semi-memorable, and interesting characters. high stakes plot line, and oh man the city itself is freaking amazing artistically. CD Projekt Red stated before launch that while the main story was going to be short, that they were going to focus most of their energy into side quests. This was not the case. After the 25 hr main story, there are maybe 10  side quests tops with story that is fleshed out. The game just feels gutted, and if i had been told honestly that i was going to be paying for a 30 hour cyberpunk action-adventure story, with skill trees, but minimal roleplay elements. I would have just waited for a sale.\nCD Projekt Red straight up lied about how much content there would be, very closely before the launch. Side quests, in the lens of their previous work (the witcher), was assumed by gamers to mean roleplay heavy story quests. People did not think that would mean a bunch of blips on a map, that are either Kill/steal/rescue missions with nothing more for interaction than a one-way phone conversation from an npc.",

Personally I would prefer not to choose and just be able to max out everything over time. The combat is fun though. A plethura of combat styles for pretty much everybody. I also wish there were more girlfriend options. However, there are some things about side story missions I didn't enjoy very much. One in particular was the mission with the guy who ops to nail himself to a cross in lieu of a traditional execution in order to spread the gospel while taking advantage of corporate greed. That one felt exceptionally wrong. All in all though, pretty good game aside from the occasional glitches. 6/10",

        "content": "So this is a conditional yes recommendation.\n\nThe good:\nThe world building and content in the side quests is pretty amazing, and despite the bugs I've really enjoyed playing through Cyberpunk as a Nomad - that felt complete.  While I haven't experimented with other builds, I was able to put together a build that allowed me to progress through the game and do basically all of the quests open to me.  The city is also extremely well rendered and they managed to generally capture the feeling of being in a dense urban environment, along with subrubia and being out in the sticks.\n\nThe bad:\nPrimary quest chain is really short, and Acts 1 and 3 aren't all that long as you will spend the overwhelming majority of the game in Act 2.  Bugs are everywhere, and there's a lot of hooks for additional content (like rooms and what not) that isn't implemented.  Cop AI is bad, traffic AI has problems.  Stealth system isn't very deep as a low investment will get you through most of the game with stealth.\n\nOverall recommendation:\nYes if it's on sale.  As of right now, this game is not worth the full ticket price for most people.  I don't regret my preorder because I have logged enough time and enjoyed doing stuff in the game world that I feel it was worth the money, but YMMV on that point.",

There is plenty of stuff to do if like side quests and seemingly random events. If you enjoy long games, give this a shot. And i'll stress again, all the negative things are being fixed and worked on, so it does not seem to be as bad on PC as Console versions appear to have been. Now that I have played through the main story, if you like really engaging stories. This game has one, so I would think you would enjoy it.",

But instead they promised a bunch of stuff that wasn't delivered, send out a world that obviously wasn't done, had huge missing features that I can't help but to wonder if they will ever exist and then, as some sort of messed up icing to the top of the cake, had huge bugs some of which break or prevent progress. All of this is just sad really. I just wish I wasn't lied to. A really good idea botched by terrible management.\nThe game is a mess even now on 1.12 I will update in the future with the hope that I can say they finally delivered.\n ;(\n\nedit - promises broken over 9000. - Vegeta",

The characters felt very real and memorable, and though I wish they had more content I definitely 'felt' for Johnny, Panam, Judy, River, etc and enjoyed making their destinies in Night City with them. I play games mostly for the story, so that's why this is a positive review - it was a total blast, if short. Great ending variety and some surprisingly introspective moments worthy of the 'cyberpunk' name. As always a sucker for romance options, Judy's romance felt meaningful if a bit melancholy, but those two words fit in with the plot in general.\n\nWell recommended.\n",

I thinks it's a damned clusterfock in some dodgy hole in Night City  and that feels right too.

Playing this sweet game on an Acer Predator Helios 300 PH317-54 77th gaming laptop with a fresh Win10 install just fine. I have found very few bugs beyond what any new game has ever had and I've been PC gaming since 1986! My frame rates are around 120-144fps (Vsync on w/144hz display@ 1080p) and custom settings from Med-Ultra. With full RTX on w/DLSS and tweaked Ultra-Low settings for best bang for the buck my laptop performs at 55-75fps.  I am immersed! I am enjoying this game very much. Millennials complain way to much, have no patience, no diligence and are so spoiled and shitty that they take a monumental achievement like Cyberpunk 2077 and trash it because it's not perfect. I understand it was seriously borqued for a while, which they have fixed. Fuck'em all! Buy this game and enjoy!\n\nUpdate: Patch 1.22 notably has made this game even better!",

Voice acting. My impression is that at some point, the devs realized that the game was just too big and ambitious to be able to finished within a realistic timeline. So they made do with what they had.\n\nThe gameplay is really what will save the game while it continues getting patched. The gunplay and fighting is fun and fresh. But the game needs more music, more story, more sidequests, more wacky NPCs like in the Witcher. If the devs continue to work on this in DLCs, the game will gradually reach the status people hoped of it. But for the time being, the world feels unfinished and punching below its weight. The devs promised an ultra dense world. Architecturally, the city is spectacular. But once you get outside of the city and into the desert, you realize how many more details should have been included for the game to be on par with what was promised. Also I was disappointed that it is not very possible to explore any of the skyscrapers in the way I imagined it being. And I guess that is normal, because there are too many of them. But this is what happens when you make a world too big and ambitious. I hope they begin seriously cranking out DLCs because the world and the game is fun and fascinating.\n\nIf they don't give up on it, with a bunch of DLCs, this game will be a masterpiece in 5 years. But right now it is just a good game.",

You can swap genitals but there's still only binary pronouns and gender locked character customization options. If you want to see what non-binary looks like from a cis perspective then this is a much too expensive way to do so, I'd recommend watching cis people talk about non-binary issues on YT for free instead if you're really craving some pain to know you're actually alive and this isn't all a messed up simulation)\n\n**UPDATE**\nIt uninstalled itself for the second time and I'm LOSING it how do you mess up this badly ?\n\n**UPDATE**\nAfter a couple of months Cyberpunk 2077 is FINALLY worth the purchase. I'm actually having fun exploring the game and its world now. Most gamebreaking bugs are gone and the updates have been good and steady. Glad to see it's finally turning around, but still...

That said, the bugs were typically minor and it never crashed on me a single time. Mostly I had to reload a quicksave to fix a graphical glitch. Once I hacked a camera and got stuck in camera mode until I reloaded. Way less buggy than a typical Bethesda game on release, crashing every half hour or so.\n\nAs far as performance, it chugged in one mission (one of the Takenomi parade mission) and got down to 12 fps at some spots (mid range PC (2070 super) on very close to ultra settings. For 95% of the game it got over 30 fps though. Typically 40-50.\n\nGreat story and characters, Almost up to the standards of the Witcher 3. The story suffered from pacing issues at a few points though. I had a bittersweet feeling after I beat it (\"secret\" ending) that left me wanting more while knowing that it had to end somewhere, Just like a great film without a fairy tale ending. Very cyperpunk. \n\nMusic and soundtrack were very good. The game world is really cool as well. \n\n8/10 - Great game, well worth the money. I don't feel burned by CD Project on this one, unlike others seem too. I'm looking forward to a replay after a year or so, or when DLC comes out and looking forward to Witcher 4 -when its ready.",

        "content": "There's a lot I could say about Cyberpunk but I will try and keep this semi-brief. There are some things very well done and others not so much in this game. Personally if I could go back I'd wait for the price to drop and the promised patches before buying. (some tagged out of context, vague spoilers ahead)\n\nLet's start with the bad (and I'll try to be brief):\nGameplay wise\n--Buggy af (as we all know). Game crashes, UI bugs, 3D model/rigging bugs, quests bug (constantly), physics bugs. So many bugs.\n--The stealth mechanic is finicky and rarely works\n-- The \"hacking\" mechanic disrupts the flow of combat and gameplay severely. Forcing you to stop and play sudoku. \n--Vehicle controls are wonky. I'd put them slightly above Saints Row 3 vehicles. So not great but easy enough to get the hang of.\n--Enemies can be a bit bullet spongy and ammo can be a pain to come by. \nOther than that overall gameplay flows well and feels pretty similar to most FPSs. \n\nThe bad story wise and ngl I have a lot of issues with the story:\n--Story content (w/ no side quests or exploration) is only 20 some hours. Extremely short and imo the story really never goes anywhere. \n--Overall plot/story quality. I am left wondering how the studio that produced the Witcher 3 somehow also made 2077. Overall story is all over the place and ends super predictably but not in a satisfying way. In an extremely disappointing, lame way. \n--4 basic endings that are just bad. Gave me flashbacks to Mass Effect 3's blue, green and red endings. \n--Telling and never showing. Most lore is given via a codex/lore entries. Important concepts are talked about in game but [i]never[/i] actually explained to the PC. I don't mind codex/lore entries in games as supplementary but in no way was is it supplementary in Cyberpunk. Unless you are familiar with the ttrpg source material you'll be left in the dark without spending a chunk of time in the codex. \n--Tries so hard to hit every cyberpunk genre bullet in a meaningful way that is just fails completely. It touches on so many themes of the genre but with such bad takes/ themes that it's laughable. I mean for real there are  quests where I laughed all the way through because of how hard the game is trying to be edgy and deep. I mean there is legit a mission that attempts to tackle religion [spoiler]and it ends with you literally nailing a man to a cross. [/spoiler]. So painfully on the nose and in your face. \n--Other thematic issues I have mostly involve the game using the cyberpunk genre to try and make the societal commentary the genre is known for but doing it in a way that is fundamentally not punk and especially not cyberpunk. \n--Not a ton of player agency. Choices/dialogue don't really matter which was a bit of a bummer. Story plays out pretty much identically regardless of what you say and do. \n\nOkay! So now the good!\n--Visually stunning game! The environment is extremely rich and beautiful \n--Aesthetically hits every button in the genre. Very well done visuals\n--The voice acting! Wow do I love some of the the voice actors in this game. Feminine voice V's actor does a stunning job. I mean a performance on par with Jennifer Hale's femshep. \n--Some really compelling characters and character arcs, that the main plot cannot seem to match. Characters (including PC) deal with some heavy, hard hitting topics like [spoiler] suicide, terminal illness, death, betrayal, loss[/spoiler] and some of it is done really really well. There are some solid emotional impacts from the game and its characters. \n--Keanu Reeve's character. I truly was expecting Johnny Silverhand to be a memey- just there for the novelty character. Instead we get a nuanced character with an amazing performance. \n--Character models and facial expressions are all solid. I've seen some people claim 2077 falls into uncanny valley bad but honestly I thought they did a great job on character models/rigging of side characters (not so much random NPCs)\n--Some really solid LGBTQ+ characters. I know there was some major controversy before release and a number of frankly problematic things in the game regarding gender and gender equality [i]but[/i] there are some great LGBTQ+ characters\n--Fun. This game is straight up fun. Despite the meh story. Unfortunately the bad story/questlines and gamebreaking bugs all contribute to the ridiculous fun this game can be. Possibly borders on a game so bad it's good. \n\nUltimately Cyberpunk 2077 [i]is[/i] a fun game. I have had a ton of fun playing it but I [i]do[/i] feel like it's because I gave up on the main plot to focus on enjoying the side quests, characters and exploration. It just did not meet the expectations and hype the game had built up. The game feels extremely catered to cishet male players which is kind of a bummer for a game attempting to encapsulate the cyberpunk genre. And honesty I felt that Projekt Red just couldn't quite figure out what type of story they wanted to tell with Cyberpunk 2077 and ended up with something along the lines of [spoiler]\"Die historic on fury road\" but make it Night City[/spoiler], and did not live up to the game and story promised that was originally promised. \n\n\n\n",

        "content": "If your PC can run it - I think it's really good.  The game could use work like on the AI and but it's not as bad as all the meme warriors say it is.  Really stable - in 280 hours 4 hard crashes none resulting in significant lost time but a pretty high amount of graphical glitches (though it still looks better than any game I have ever seen).  I'm not really good enough at shooting / fps games to really say how good the combat is but it was okay for me.  I understand more experienced players of this type of game didn't like the gun play (I used keyboard mouse throughout except for driving) and the melee boxing is not that great (can confirm myself I didn't really get on with this).  Melee with swords wasn't too bad though even on hard for me as a crappy player it seemed a bit easy mode with a decent Katana...so maybe that needs balancing out a bit.\n\nDidn't try all weapons yet to be honest.\n\nPLEASE NOTE : I had pretty big bug issues before the NVidia Game Ready Driver update (this was actually ready release day).  In addition, and I think this was the key one for me, my computer said it was up to date but Microsoft had not pushed the latest update to me (20H2).  You can get this download direct from Microsoft (not through update in my case) After I installed this everything was pretty much okay with this game bug wise.  Type in Winver in the search bar in WIndows 10 and check...\n\nIgnore those entitled people who expect the world on a plate and they \"deserve it for being so master race\".  For \u00a350 you get a ton of content, great music, story and acting.  Sorry you guys got butt-hurt because you couldn't customise your cock as much you wanted.  I get it's a bit of a bait and switch but it's still very good game and ground breaking in a lot of ways (on PC).\n\nIf you have a console and happen upon this review for some reason, IMHO from I can see online and in videos this is not in a release state - give it a miss until they fix it they don't deserve your money until then particularly not when they clearly released it for the Christmas period simply to make extra dough.",

        "content": "Overall this isn't bad, it's just boring and not very immersive or rewarding to play. I honestly didn't have as much trouble with the bugs as some of the other reviewers,* I just lost interest. \n\nThe combat has no impact. Both combat and stealth repetitive while hacking is clunky, dull and disruptive (also repetitive). The user interface for menus is also clunky and counter-intuitive. Exploration feels pointless because you can't interact with the environment in any meaningful way and there's no attention to detail. Every NPC and every item you find is generic, randomly generated according to finite parameters. The city looks impressive at first, but after a couple hours you realize you're running around in a giant wax museum. There's nothing to discover except another generic building with a slightly differentiated floor plan and two dozen doors that don't open. It's like trying to swim in an inch deep ocean: I don't care if I can see water for miles if I can't drink it or immerse myself in it. \n\nYou can break into somebody's house swinging a baseball bat and wearing nothing but combat boots and a banana hammock and get no reaction. You can set off a bomb on one street, run into a store and rob the owner blind, then steal a car and get basically no response.  You want to claim a bounty? Scan them, kill them and watch numbers appear on the top right corner of your screen as your character magically generates wealth. Nobody much seems to mind. \n\nBecause the items you get are all generic with randomly generated stats, it doesn't even feel rewarding. Worse yet, it ruins the immersion. You'll find yourself in what's supposed to be a serious, corporate-espionage mission and you have to switch from your carbon-fiber military grade sneaking suit to a neon pink gimp-suit and orange tennis shoes so that you don't have get killed. \n\nIt's an ambitious project with some genuine beauty that doesn't go any deeper than the skin. And even that cosmetic appeal wears thin after you've heard the same line of dialogue or the same elevator broadcast for the 10,00th time. \n\nThe driving is also terrible. Trying to navigate Night City is thoroughly aggravating, though it helps that there're are absolutely no real consequences for any of your actions and you're therefore free to run down pedestrians with impunity. \n",

I have logged about 20 hours of game time as of Feb 2021, and I haven't even scratched the surface. I have a pretty short attention span when it comes to learning new things, but this game is so interesting, I can't stop playing. Definitely worth the money.\n\nEDIT: As of October 2021, CKPR has done massive work on this game. I picked it up after about 3 months or so of giving up because of some of the issues. Honestly after the recent patches, this game is a masterpiece. I have played about 40 hours now and have barely scratched the surface. The main characters are interested and engaging, the city feels alive, and there's so much to do and see. I can play for hours just doing assaults or exploring a new street. The political and economic undertones make the game feel real without overpowering the adventure feeling, and the crafting and equipment interfaces are improved A LOT. I love this game and I am so glad I decided to risk playing it again.",

The only problem I have with this game is the bugs, and they have not been that much of an influence on my playthrough.

I've had just 2 visual bugs, one was fixed after day 1 patch and the second was a gun in a NPCs hand during story dialogue.\n\nThe game itself is great, the story and world are vast and detailed. There are so many cool side stories and characters that you could miss if you aren't the meticulous type. The combat is flawed but it works, there are certain build routes that make encounters laughable so future tuning of it through mods or patches could make it shine. Overall the game is great, the ambiance and world are fantastic but its underlying game systems are a few steps short.\n\nDon't buy into the negative press vying for clicks, this game is a must play either now or when the wave of mods start pouring in",

I've given up completely on actually playing the game and am now only trying to experience the story in the safest way possible but STILL can't seem to do that without infinitely falling through the world, missions not starting when they're supposed to, important dialogue not playing, or some other game breaking glitch occurring.\n\nThis game is fundamentally broken in ways that are difficult to describe without experiencing it for yourself, which given its price, I strongly recommend you don't. Even without glitches the gameplay is still so rudimentary, stiff, and boring, that it's just not fun to play.\n\nThis game, to put it simply, sucks.",

Tried all the fixes, updating drivers, verifying cache, etc. , same problem. Absolutely pathetic for a \"AAA\" title. Honestly thisll' be the last time I buy a triple A.

Some of the moments with the characters in this game are absolutely phenomenal. I enjoyed my experiences with them, the voice acting and the writing  both work wonders for making these characters feel like real people and really making you connect with them. And to be clear, it's NOT like Fallout where you decide your character and how they act, it's more-so you get a character and you choose how they look. V exists, V has a personality already there. The game isn't \"hit or miss\" with forming friendships/relationships with the character. It hits the mark dead on, and if you're looking for a game that gets you invested in characters, this is that game.",

        "content": "A fabulous game, I am obviously hooked, as you can see by my playtime. Not going into a long assay about the game, so I am gonna try to condense this review as much as possible.\nAs any game game there are issues. Unfortunately this one has a considerable number of bugs. I've heard there are many problems in old consoles, but this is not the case with me. I have a relatively good computer, and I am afraid you will need to have one in order to play smoothly and without crashes. Had 5 of those in 580 hours, all while tying to load a save, so no big issue for me. Some FPS drops while driving downtown, but again, just notice the number of cars, pedestrians and lights there,so, I am not shocked. it\u00b4s a heavy game. I've said it before. Most bugs are graphical in nature, some are due to poor/IA implementation. I reckon the game was rushed due to publisher and/or investor pressure, but even so, due to the level of things in the game and it\u00b4s complexity, let\u00b4s give the developers a break, shall we? Enough vitriol over an excellent game. I am positive, given enough time, these issues will be overcome.\nNow, the story is enticing, very well written, with lots of character depth. If you are into this kind of thing, this game is for you. For RPG lovers, this title is also very good, although the game has not the best character development considering perks/feats  and so one, it does a good enough job. Combat is fluid, shooting with a silenced weapon with a scope, slashing enemies with your katana or whatever fells very rewarding. Some have complained about the driving experience, but there are mods out there that improve upon the experience and give up extra options. Clothing selections, mods and a plethora of different weapon add to the depth of the game.\n To be frank, the worst part of this game is the length of the main story. it could be about 30% longer, at least. Also, there could be more side quests and gigs in general. I understand content was cut due to lack of time and pressure to release the game. So, here is the cause of all problems. Time. CDPR is now working on bug fixes and stability, but I anxiously wait for more content. let the DLCs come. Maybe  multiplayer in the future? One can only hope for.",

It's a typical release for the type of game developers that are out there now days with the quick hype, grab, and leave mentality.  And they wonder why the industry is slowly going under.  Gameplay is very empty after about 2 hours.\n\n",

        "content": "After playing a bit, I can recommend this game. \n\nYou likely already know all about it - but from my perspective there should be more praise for the variety of play styles on offer. Leveling up to the point where you have these options is time consuming [you start off pretty weak and the RPG approach of leveling is unavoidable] but I enjoyed the open world, story and voice acting the whole time it took to get strong enough for the game to really open up. \n\nMid-to-late game you have an enjoyable variety of solid play options. Pure melee is a valid way to play through the entirety of the game and it's fun. So is pure guns. You can make your character faster, with double jumps, and with bonuses for charging in guns ablazin' and all of a sudden you're playing a traditional DOOM-style FPS. Slowing down time and dodging while shooting is reminiscent of Max Payne. You can go stealth and silenced weapons with just a bit of ranged tech abilities and the game plays like Deus Ex. Focus on hacking and you're playing Watch Dogs. \n\nThat's not to say the game is just a mix of old ideas. Open world games are often \"stealth or strength\" \"ranged or melee\" or \"swords, arrows or magic\" but it's rare when a game can find a balance with all the options valid, deep and enjoyable without a defined class - so you can end up with a unique mix of whatever abilities you're in the mood for and still have a good time. \n\nI can mention the beautifully realized world, temper my recommendation with warnings about the bugs (I'd have every achievement if it wasn't for one), weak AI, and the current lack of promised multiplayer (or a bunch of other stuff you already know), but I haven't seen enough attention brought to the fact that you can play however you want. It's what I dig the most. \n\nI suspect this achievement in variety makes some bugs (WHY DOES DRIVING SUCK?) seem especially odd. Still, overall, easy to recommend. Fun to get lost in. Plenty to do for 150hrs. Not perfect but I'm ok with a touch of the 'ol jank.",

Its hard to describe the core issue I have with the game but one way of saying it is this game treats the cyberpunk genre as just an aesthetic for a mediocre rpg/fps, instead of an ideology (not quite the right word but I can't find it rn) with themes of anti-capitalism, corporations taking over, transhumanism, etc. Not to say the game doesn't touch on or mention that stuff, but it never goes into to anything in enough detail to actually say something about those topics. This isn't even mentioning the graphical/gameplay glitches but that stuff is secondary to my real issue. Maybe I expected too much but the trailers made it seem like a game that meant something more than \"yay shooting and the occasional decision\".\n\nTL;DR- If you want to play a game in the cyberpunk genre that actually means something (unlike this one), try 2064 Read Only Memories.",

I am new to reviews and will try to use the style of reviewers that I respect.\n\nFirst I will state that I am a PC gamer so I cannot speak for console versions.\n\nSecond my PC specs are as follows:\n\n9th gen Intel I5 processor\n16 GB RAM\nTi 1050 4 GB graphics card\nSSD hard drive\n\nSo on with my review\n\nGame 8.5/10\n\nPros\n\nGraphics are really nice, running 2K at nearly max settings (I disable stuff like motion blur. Anti aliasing is a relic from low res monitors from years ago).\n\nStory haven't finished yet (at 75% I think) but compelling, immersive, great characters, I disagree that Keanu is wooden I like his performance it fits the setting. Anybody who liked Mass Effect will like this. This has those big moments of WTF that mass effect had.\n\nGame world FRICKING AWESOME I thought Boston in Fallout 4 was amazing, same with Novigrad in The Witcher 3. Night City and it's surroundings just mind blowing. In the Witcher 3 you soon just used fast travel (same mechanic here) but I don't I want to roam the city.\n\nGame stability I might be lucky, I have only had one CTD.\n\nOkay on with the cons\n\nWorld A lot of placeholder stuff such as empty gamezones in a couple of places which are immersion breaking (no NPC's in an industrial zone). AI of traffic and pedestrians is poor\n\nSome quests cannot be completed as the trigger does not happen, few I have only had a problem with sidequests (3 of many)\n\nAny other problem I have with this game in it's current state is just quality of life and customization of character and range of equipment.\n\nThis should never have been released for last gen consoles. The money people got greedy and diverted the dev team from doing the full game.\n\nBut Buy this game, it's still awesome and it will get better.\n\nUpdate after patch 1.52 and upgrading to an RTX 3050.\n\nThis game just gets more awesome. Most georgeous gameworld ever. If you were unsure before now buy it now.",

All (or, at the very least most) of the truly game-breaking bugs have now been ironed out, and overall performance has been improved accross the board. The game world also feels much more fleshed out and \"alive\" than it did upon release. The game is still not perfect, in that it still does not contain every feature that was promised by the devs before release, but it is a LOT better than it was when it was first launched. Recommended, if your system has the chops to run it.",

        "content": "Although this game didn't quite live up to expectations, it is still one of the best RPGs I have played in my time. \n\nIf you're like me, and like getting immersed into a game, to experience it, then, yeah I recommend it. \nThe main story is all kinds of riveting, screwed up, and moving. Prepare for an emotional rollercoaster. \n\nI came from skyrim and fallout, so I'm used to saving after literally anything happens, just to be safe. So the bugs weren't really a problem for me, besides snapping me out of my immersion here and there. I personally didn't experience any bugs that I couldn't fix by simply reloading my last save.\nI played at modified low settings on a 1060, i7 8700. Definitely need an upgrade, just pointing out that you can experience the game on a fairly lower end computer without too many problems. Or at least, that's my experience. \nI will mention, however, that I my bf has a 2070 and allowed me to stream the game from his computer at to mine at times, so I have also experienced modified high settings. Definitely a lot more enjoyable, but that's to be expected.\n\nI personally wish my character didn't look like such crap in the mirrors, I spent so much time making her look hot as hecc in character creation, and proceeded to launch the game for the first time and nearly had a heart attack. Minor complaint, just avoid mirrors until they fix that.\n\nI spent 75 hours on my first playthrough, doing side hussles, trying to build up my relationship with Johnny (got him to about 60% by the time I was ready to do the last main story mission) and experiencing Night City, it's views, it's easter eggs, and the relationships that you can form. A lot of the time I would have fun just taking my motorbike out for a spin and just driving around and listening to music. Even with that 75 hour first playthrough I still don't feel like I experienced half of what was put into the game for me to experience. And so, I am starting another playthrough!\n\nI know a lot of controversy has surrounded this game, but please be sure to blame upper management and not the devs that worked their butts off to build this game! Building a game takes time, energy and a lot of code fixing. As someone who has played around with code, and having a so with coding knowledge, we are both aware it takes a lot of work! He had to build a simple text game for school last year and it took him 2 and a half weeks to smooth out the errors and make it playable. Fix one bug, 99 more shall appear...\nI feel for the devs that had so many more plans for this game and it was ripped away from them before it was ready. and you know they probably had to work overtime during the holidays to fix it because management decided it was ready and to release it to the public. I can't say I know for sure that's what happened, but in these situations, that's usually what happens. \nI have already noticed a lot of the bugs I have experienced being fixed (one of my first complaints was getting a tarot reading from Misty and she placed down invisible cards, that's not an issue anymore! I noticed it fixed like 2 days later)\nGame still has some rendering issues, but I'm sure that'll be sorted out.\nAll in all, not a bad experience. Would recommend, 9/10",

I played all the way through with one character and build, and I'm playing all the way through again with another.  I'm enjoying myself quite a bit.\n\nIf bugs break your immersion, hold off.  Revisit this game in a few months and see. The story is excellent, Keanu Reeves gave a fantastic performance, and I'm having a great time.",

It's a really mediocre game, with a generally interesting main story and some of the side missions are okay, but none of the hundreds of mini-distractions really have any meaning or impact in the lifeless city. \n\nThe shooting is crap, the melee is much worse than Skyrim, and the arbitrary stealth system isn't satisfying either, especially when entering sudden hostile areas with no warning whatsoever. It'd be nice to highlight these areas on the minimap or something.\n\nDriving is absolutely joyless, and it takes forever to get anywhere - even at an indicated 150mph, the metres on the HUD creep by with depressing lethargy.\n\nThere are lots of immersion-breaking glitches, and the ending of the main story makes no sense whatsoever - it feels like there is so much left unexplained.\n\nIt's hard to care for any of the characters, as most of the time I have no idea who on earth they are. They are catapulted into the story with little or no introduction, and then disappear equally quickly. The supposed nemesis Adam Smasher is an absolute bit part at best, and yet we're supposed to have some kind of internal monologue to decide his fate... I couldn't care less!\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game I'm afraid - it could have been really good, but it's bland and fairly soulless. The mechanics are most to blame for this, but the character exposition is also pretty naff.",

I'm disappointed with how certain characters were treated (Takemura, Dex, T-Bug, Evelyn Parker and Jackie). It felt that they were used only to progress the story and nothing else they didn't matter beyond their use. \n\nJackie is your friend [spoiler] who gets killed during a big mission he is mentioned every once and awhile and yes you can have moments where his death affects you but [/spoiler] he is put in the backseat for most of the story. \n\nTakemura is an interesting character as he was the personal bodyguard of the leader of Arasaka, [spoiler] who gets killed by his son, which you witnessed. He ends up saving you as he suspects that the son was the one who killed him. [strike] He dies anti-climatically as well, you don't even get to see him die either [/strike] [/spoiler] [strike] which may be something explored in a later DLC. [/strike]\n\nDexter is the guy who sets you up with the job to steal from Arasaka. [spoiler] After it all goes tits up he kills you....or tries at least. He ends up getting killed rather anti-climatically by Takemura. [/spoiler]\n\nT-Bug is a netrunner whom you know through past missions that you never get to play she helps with the heist at the beginning of the story. [spoiler] Shes killed during the heist [/spoiler] unfortunately, her exact fate is never revealed (Perhaps future DLC?).\n\nEvelyn Parker is the woman who requests the heist from Dexter. [spoiler] She ends up dying after a long series of missions that result in her suicide. [/spoiler] The sad part is that she could've easily done far more in the story. I actually kinda liked her.\n\nThese five seemed integral to the story yet I felt that they weren't used to their full potential. \n\nJackie was used as a motivator for V. [spoiler] His death [/spoiler] is seemingly meant to push V to accomplish the goal of removing the [spoiler] biochip [/spoiler] from your head he should've been popping into V's head far more throughout the story. \n\nT-Bug could've been used for much more than a throwaway character. She could've been your contact at the Voodoo Boys. Her [spoiler] death [/spoiler] is fairly wide open so my guess is DLC or maybe not. \n\nDexter could been an easy side gig in tracking him down [spoiler] and giving V the satisfaction of killing him for what he did to you. Let's not forget that the reason you have the biochip issue in the first place is because Dex decided to attempt to kill you which caused the biochip to activate and boom the story begins. V deserved to be the one to kill Dex in a satisfying side gig. [/spoiler]\n\nEvelyn Parker is a big one [spoiler] that was very surprising the way that she died. I thought she could've easily been used far more in the story perhaps not only helping you figure out what to do about the Voodoo boys but also with the final heist perhaps she could've used her connections with Yorinobu (Saburo's son) to get you a way in the tower. [/spoiler]\n\nEdit: Some of my information is incorrect as the outcome of a certain character [spoiler] Takemura [/spoiler] can be changed if certain decisions are made. I have learned this after a second playthrough. Although this only affects the outcome of one character. My opinion on other characters still stands. Glitch on chooms!",

Crashing issues have been resolved, everything that's there does work now, no bugged abilities or stats that don't do anything. \n\nWould absolutely recommend, CDPR has actually gotten this to where it needs to be for a recommendation, even at full price, all the better if it goes on sale. \n\nUpdate as of 1.5 Patch:\n\nIt's...better. \n\nThe fixes are there, and the product is a lot more stable. They're slowly bringing in what they promised during development and the game is basically where it should have been at launch. \n\nThat being said. \n\nThere's still swathes of stuff missing, though that is changing and CDPR are putting their money where their mouth is and not charging for DLC until the game's done. Bravo, good for them, I do have to applaud that. \n\nStill wouldn't recommend this title if you don't already own it, but if you do, and gave up around launch, it's worth another shot. \n\n-----------------------Old Review from just after Launch -----------------------------------\n\nNot even remotely close to what was promised in the run-up to this title's release. \n\nCDPR has utterly bamboozled both the gaming media and gamers. They should be ashamed of themselves for this polished turd. \n\nNothing you do matters. At all. The entire story, for the most part, with a few minor exceptions, is on rails. They've swapped story, gameplay, worldbuilding, for sex scenes, shitty dialogue, and poor pathing and level design, they lied about the levels customisation, and none of the backgrounds have any affect on the story whatsoever. \n\nNo you can't:\n\nCustomise your car\nCustomise your character after creation\nBuy other apartments\nHave \"meaningful interactions with characters in the game\"\nMake choices that have an affect on the story ( prepare to see everything first time through, basically ) \n\nThe list goes on, seriously, just look at what they promised and then go watch some reviews. It's cringe. \n\nMost importantly, though, your denied even the remotest sense of accomplishment. \n\nThis game, as a lot of the tech press is saying, is just GTA V reskinned to look like an 80's interpretation of a Cyberpunk universe, except worse than GTA in every meaningful way. \n\nAnd by GTA I mean San Andreas, not V, that comparison is an insult to GTA V. \n\nDon't buy this until CDPR fixes it and actually releases what they promised. \n\nTo Valve - You guys should be investigating this sort of stuff a lot more deeply than you are, CP2077 being what it is reflects *really badly* on your platform. Again, CDPR, after the No Man's Sky debacle, has shown just how little you guys care about your customers by letting big developers just straight up lie to customers, on your own platform. \n\nThis has to stop. I haven't trusted Pre-Orders in a decade, but this mess is big enough to have spilled over into your camp. \n\nFix it. Stop letting devs pull this crap. There has to be consequences.",

The devs are working on that, but it will take about until late 2021 - early 2022\n\nGood story, not great, but good. The game isn't too grindy, but lacks good writing at multiple moments in the game. Combat reminds me of Deus Ex Mankind Divided, its not too great and feels sort of clunky at first, but if you get used to it, its pretty ok. Driving isn't the worst as people make it seem to be (for me anyhow).\n\nI'm mostly disappointed by how your choices don't make much of a difference in a LOT of the game. It feels barebones compared to fallout.\n\nI know my review doesn't sound like i'm really recommending the game, but thats not the case. I think this game is better than a lot of games out there, and personally I don't think the game is all too bad. I've had some fun and I love the characters and moments in the main story line.\n\nIf you're wanting to buy the game though, wait until later and add it to your wishlist. I've heard rumors that they're going to add back cut content and stuff to the game, but if that is not true then the worst case scenario is you wait to play a fixed stable version of the game.",

        "content": "A long while ago I played the PC version of Cyberpunk and wrote a pretty scathing review of it. The game was completely broken, and the majority of the review was a lengthy list of game breaking bugs I encountered. Stuff such as being unable to select anything but the first dialog option, characters rising from the dead only to wander over to a chair and die officially, and in one instance being launched into space upon completion of a side mission and having to wait quite a while to actually return to the ground.\n\nWith the release of the Netflix anime Edgerunners, I was inspired to go through the game a second time in a morbid curiosity of if the game was finally playable. To my surprise the answer was mostly yes. Now, that's not to say we're dealing with a 10 out of 10 game here. Nothing Cyberpunk does is something we haven't seen in other games, and more often than not the other game accomplishes doing it quite a bit better. However, the game no longer feels like it's actively battling your attempts to play it.\n\nNow that's not to say bugs don't still exist. They do. However for the most part these are very minor glitches like an NPC resetting their sitting position in mid dialog. The only bad glitch that required me to save, close the game, and reopen it to fix was after doing a specific mission my scan button ceased to function.\n\nThe side quests in this game are mostly all good. The main quest is fairly enjoyable as well. But the majority of your time will be in open world experience of running around killing groups of enemy gang members, and doing other menial tasks (called gigs). It's fairly mindless. But if you're seeing a time wasting open world Assassin Creedy kinda game, it's not the worst option.\n\nThe abusive practices the company did to the devs is still a problem, and one can hope the whole debacle made CD Project Red actually learn from it all. Both treating their crew better, and not rushing games out when they're basically still in alpha. But that is a question to answer in the future. For now, the game is at least worth checking out if you're bored. So I'll change my review to recommended.\n\nI just hope they put a little bit more TLC in their upcoming DLC plans if they hope to actually sell it.",

There's a huge load of reviews on youtube where you can see loads of gameplay issues and bugs with this game.\n\nSo here is what happens now when I load up my saved games with this new \"major update\":\n\nI get a video call from an npc and he just stares at me, I literally cant progress in the game. This is the dumbest thing Ive seen from a game of this scale, I cant understand how this game has mostly positive reviews,. This unplayable broken diarrhea of a game just has to be the worst cash steal in modern history. I am currently recording this experience to upload this on youtube and will edit this review once I have the link.\n\n\n",

        "content": "Fun game, story was engaging. Approached it for the slow burn and didn't rush through story, which I think helped keep me engaged. I have a higher end rig, and still got loads of visual bugs, didn't bother me too much as nothing was gamebreaking really. Biggest frustration I had was with not being able to rebind the dash, which made being stealthy/not having pedestrians randomly run in fear annoying. You can get a mod for this of course, I'm just wary of mods for now being the amount of patches and updates coming as seen with the engine tweaks mod. Inventory is rough, crafting system is meh, but perk tree seemed pretty good to me though. \n\nGame is worth it for Night City itself, the main story/side quests, and main story characters. Not many games had as authentic character interactions, and it felt nice to play a game that was made with adults in mind. Sure you're on a hero's journey, but most of the time you are doing what's in your best interest. You can choose to try and do the greater good, but even when you try to do this there can be unintended consequences. Choices felt impactful at times as well. Would recommend.",

        "content": "update: 1.31.21 original review below.\n\nSo I originally thought my headache was the style of the game. While I hadn't played an FPS in years I grew up playing them, so clearly it was the lights and coloring.... WRONG!!! Was bored and grabbed another (older) FPS to play that's much more muted and had the same issue!! Then my partner looked at me and was like \"well of course, you're moving your head around like crazy trying to watch everything!!!\" OOPS\n\nWith that, back into CyberPunk as my current binge game while I wait for the next BG3 patch. Can now play for hours on end with no headache. Occasionally find graphical glitches and bugs, but I never expect to be 100% free of those. Only found one quest breaking bug so far. It's big enough I got annoyed and started a new game to avoid, but also it's discussed in multiple forums so it's not just a me issue and it's a main plot bug so I know it'll be fixed eventually.\n\nMy earlier comments about enjoying the story and thinking the world looks stunning still stands. I'm also still annoyed by clicking a dialogue option and having V not say exactly what the option said. Picked me a few fights I didn't want to pick because of the tone and attitude difference.\n\nOverall, is it perfect, no. But is it *bad* also no. Just has a bunch of room to grow.\n\n\n\n\noriginal review:\n\nI haven't noticed any issues or bugs so far aside from the occasional minor graphic thing (accidentally turn my camera part way into a wall and it seizures for a moment trying to figure out what it's supposed to do because it knows it shouldn't be in a wall type of thing, that every game has at some point somewhere)\n\nSo far I'm enjoying the story, I do hate that V doesn't say exactly the text in the selected dialogue option. I'll read something one way, select it, then V will say it worded slightly different in a way that completely changes the tone from what was written. But overall more a nuisance than game breaking.\n\nHonestly the only reason I don't have more hours in this game is because it gives me headaches. The bright neon coloring and the close attempt at realism in graphics is just too much, and it's this motion sick type feeling. Despite that I'm still able to put in 20 mins here, 30 mins there and am absolutely loving it so far.",

Overall, I would play this game if your are looking for a game that makes you feel like an anime protagonist. The variety of in depth builds you can develop over the course of the game makes you feel like an anime protagonist due to your increase in strength, movement capabilities, loot, gear, and skills. Once you are several hours in the game you unlock some of the most unique slow motion skills I have ever seen in a game which can completely change how you approach a combat sequence. The world of cyberpunk also feels inspired by many sci-fi worlds in other media including anime which propels the role even more. Dial back your expectations a few notches and you'll prob like it.",

These big games that people get excited for, could just turn into a technical mess when it comes out because of limited production. I'm glad to say CDPR stood by what they said and have greatly improved the game over the past year and a half. Missions, performance, the overall environment feels and plays so much better then it did when it was released. I was still not discouraged by their promise and with the anime series airing on Netflix, its perfect timing to come back into the game after watching it gave me more attraction to enjoy the game a lot more. I love the world they created here.",

Now with the 1.1 patch it introduced a game breaking bug, where Takamura calls me, never speaks, never hangs up. Now I'm unable to continue in any way or form from anything (because the game thinks I'm on a call). This ruined my save with all the progress (loading a few a bit older saves doesn't solve anything) \n\nTime to put this game away and wait for the 2.0 release. But I think this will be just an expensive lesson that again don't trust words,  but trust actions. The actions of CDPR don't inspire trust, for a 1.1 patch there is not enough fixed, and even more is broken now. I don't see CDPR ever doing a \"No Man's Sky\". \n\nShame on me for having trust in a company, and shame on me for giving them the chance to impress me. I should have refunded when it was still possible,",

        "content": "I am recommending 2077...but with a huge caveat. \n\nI played through the game before writing this. I did not experience the game stopping bugs or horrible issues that most faced, but that is not to say i didn't experience many, many, many bugs, glitches and issues throughout. I really, really wanted to like this game, I did enjoy much of it. \n\nMy biggest issue wasn't the glitches and bugs, it wasn't the deceptive tactics used in its promotion, it is the dialogue, story and quality of life as a player in the game. \n\nNo, I won't be playing it over and over to see different ends or even different beginnings ( like I did with fallout or the mass effect franchises)  because none of the choices seem like good ones, or meaningful, or even like choices at all. Most of the game functions like this, and with Keanu in it - it harkins back to the idea of choice from another franchise of his. \n\nIt's a tromp through tropes, but at least i got this cool Trauma Team vest out of it.\n\nIn game, I talk like a 20 year old dim-witted punk kid ( even as a corpo) with few and far between, scattered lines that are actually intelligent. I befriend people who make really poor and rash decisions while spilling their life story like we are in a CW show, and worse, they all speak in some rather superficial heavy accents and use their obvious culture as a prop rather than a motivation, which is exacerbated by some rather racist economic, ethnic and geographic separations in Night City. \n\nFor some reason Night City, and society in general, has become an over-sexed, over-served, wildly obnoxious, rude, and vacuous hive of alcoholics and warlords who either are guilting you into drinking every conversation, trying to kill you, or simply harassing you with the same obscure line of dialogue every time they see you.\n\n You end up more at strip clubs, brothels and back alleys, than anywhere else and though you can dress like anything, get tons of street cred, and carry an arsenal on your person that wouldn't fit in a closet, it never makes any real difference in how people treat you.( unless you start shooting- then they beg for their lives which gave me horrific flashbacks to the 5 minutes of Postal i played)\n\nAmong the many things littering the world, the worst are the countless shards that beg for you to take them, and even have to be read to progress some gigs. While you have a small and tidy phone book, you will pick up hundreds( literally) of these small shards that are more about exposition and attempts to fill out the back story of the world than something relevant and engaging. they are all accessible through a list that provides neither context nor any real incentive to read them. Many times these shards are just variations of the same too-cool-for-school dialogue between two unknown people with little or no clue as to what they are talking about. If you don't stop in the middle of a mission to read the essay on why Night City, it's inhabitants, and it's AIs are so dysfunctional, then maybe you can read it later while you crouch waiting for the cool-down on System Reset. \n\nSpeaking of non lethal, Let's talk about the idea of non-lethal game play. Shooting someone is pretty lethal. Shooting someone a few dozen times with an assault rifle is definitely lethal and no implant in YOUR head changes that, now or in the future. Deus Ex had a variety of non lethal weapons, but in 2077, there are only non-lethal melee and a pretend idea that shooting someone with a gun can be \"safe\". This choice of being non-lethal plays out basically the same as lethal, they just don't actually die, but they don't wake up either.\n\nDay, night, 3 am or 6pm , today, tomorrow, yesterday - time is talked about, meeting are set, but sometimes they don't really mean it and other times they do. You get to guess if their urgency should be headed or not. \nThis \"mean-it-but-don't\" kinda of emphasis is so wide spread and erratic you are never sure if you know if you have time to go see if the clothing vendor finally has a purple Bitch shirt in stock or if they are still just are selling more ripped t-shirts that have more armor than the orange ballistic vest you've wearing for 10 levels.\n \nThe only vehicles that seem reasonably drivable on PC are the bikes. This works to the player's advantage because the traffic and traffic systems in Night city are random at best, and non-sensibly chaotic at worse. By the way. crosswalks mean nothing to the driver who will run you down in the street like a dog. \n\nThis game can certainly push into 100 hours. So if you only want to play it once, then why not allow far more choice and accessibility to clothes, crafting recipes, and such in the game in one play through?  Crafting is near meaningless for clothes, and very stingy for any decent weapon until you get to a pretty high crafting level. I didn't choose to mod, farm or exploit, and though i spent way too much on clothes, much of it was pointless - I wore the same glasses for 40 levels because i couldn't find any with better stats. How could i justify spending 120K on a gun that i  will be out of in a couple missions ?\n\nSo with all these issues i had, what was good? The combat system, parts of Night City, the skill system, about half of the clothes, most of the weapons, and about half of the crafting mechanics.  I recommend it because there is some really nice work cobbled into the very broken framework. There are beautiful moments and some really fun gigs. There are diverse skill paths, and the world is reminiscent of some of my favorite sci fi ( and likely yours too). There are some beautiful vistas, some fun hidden gems, and the enjoyment and recognition of the many, many hours of some very talented people trying to make this game great. \n\nSo... i do recommend it to PC players- but read the posts, watch the reviews and know exactly what you are getting into.",

My favorite part of open world games is exploring and this you can do all day. Bottom line, fun game play, looking forward to continuing and replay.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 is what I've seen being referred to as an \"unfinished masterpiece\". Playing through the game twice, while also exploring multiple endings, I would have to say I agree with this description of the game. It is important to look at the game from at least two aspects while assessing it - the \"Core\" aspects of the game, as well as the \"Technical\" aspects. \n\nStarting with the Core aspects ( story, quests, characters, immersion, world design/building) CDPR has done an absolutely terrific job in this regard. It is rare for me to play a game and become completely absorbed in its story. The main storyline is interesting, dark, and bittersweet (depending on how you end things - there are many different ways to complete the game). All of your choices in regard to the main story line has an effect on the way things play out. Remember that decision you made 20 hours? Yeah, that could/will affect your choices/options later down the road. Even playing through the game a second time, while only really making small changes to the way I played made me have a different experience. \nIt is unfortunate that the backstory you pick never really has any impact on the main story apart from certain dialogue options. The first 20 minutes are different and unique, but it ultimately terminates into the same story and if you've played through the game more than once, you will quickly be \"back to the usual\". That's not to say it's bad - the story is really great and immersive, exploring a dark future where no matter how desperately one fights against oppressive systems and individuals, the world still wins.\nThe characters that are the heavy, narrative driven storylines are among some of the best I've ever come across. All of them go through a series of quests where your choices greatly impact the outcome (and also their relationship to you). Some of these characters are romanceable, something which was crafted in a really great manner. Again, these choices and whatnot will impact your playthrough, adding more ambiguity to how you play your game. I'm not a \"creative\" or \"art-enjoying\" individual, but the stories these characters go through are art to me. Their stories are immersive, and the development they go through feels \u201cbelievable\u201d. I sincerely hope that we get to experience more in future content or DLCs. \nThe world design is beautiful - exploring its many secrets and worlds is awesome. From the Corpos of the City Center, to the Streetkids in the slums of Kabuki, to the beautiful but unforgiving Badlands and its Nomad clans. At times the game would feel somewhat empty, probably due to the (supposedly) cut content. The world is graphically amazing, actually making go out and purchase a new GPU to experience the beauty of the game to a greater potential. Finally, the last Core aspect I will touch upon before moving on - the music. \"Wow\" - that's the first word that comes to mind. Throughout the game, the soundtrack is absolutely one of the best parts of the game. The in-game radio with its various music types and artists, the story related band Samurai and their punk rock songs (these are absolutely amazing and I cannot get enough of it!), but also the gameplay soundtrack - just wow. Music is used expertly in this game to immerse you, but also to emphasize story-critical moments while also making your choices \"weigh\" more heavily on you. Sometimes it makes you feel like a badass. Sometimes it puts you at a crossroads for whatever decisions you're gonna make. Sometimes you just forget that it's a game, and when music does that, it means it's on a different level.\n\nSadly, the Technical aspects of Cyberpunk 2077 cannot be ignored. The lackluster AI, the catastrophic launch, the in-game bugs, and the driving. The NPC AI is one of the most life-absent AI I've experienced - NPCs don't act human, they will react to you in a way that will definitely break your immersion, make you laugh, or perhaps just frustrate you. The police are a joke in the game, never chasing after you when a crime has been committed (if you run far enough), and if you decide to fight them they will spawn behind you in wasp-like swarms, easily overpowering you unless you know what you\u2019re doing. 99% of the time I found myself running far enough away from them so they'd despawn, and the 1% of time I decided to fight them I was powerful enough to defeat them to the point where they just gave up after a while. \nThe various gangs and its AI around the world aren't much better. Most of the time you end up going to an objective where you're supposed to \"dispose of the criminals\". A reputation system with the gangs and the police which would affect your interactions with other gangs or whatnot would've been super cool. Unfortunately, it all feels like copy-pasted side missions whose purpose is to give the player an option to grind out XP and materials. They all feel the same/extremely similar so if you end up wanting to skip them, I wouldn't blame you. At a certain level and skill-build, the game just \u201cbreaks\u201d and you will easily be able to complete the game.\nMy playthroughs have been relatively bug-free. Rarely did I encounter a bug which forced me to reload a previous save, but there will be things like the AI acting stupidly, T-posing, glitching through the world and random deaths. This is something I hope will be fixed, because it greatly impacts the many Core strengths of the game. Driving feels unpolished - I'd spin out frequently and the NPC's driving also feels underwhelming. I don't think I saw a single NPC drive a bike apart from myself, so what's the point of having bikes in the game? Also, no train/subway system? Then why are there stations and trains going around the city? \nThere is, however, one great Technical aspect of the game - the combat. Yes, it will become \"easy\" and you'll feel like an absolute boss, but at least in my opinion that's good. It's a story-driven game, and the last thing I want is for this to turn into DOOM Eternal on Ultra Nightmare where I rip my hair out over the combat after spending three hours on one part of the game. There are so many ways to play the game, many of which I have yet to experience for myself. I first opted for a stealth build while using a silenced revolver. I also spliced in some light-netrunning there as well. My second playthrough I went for a more combat-oriented build. Shotguns, rifles, and snipers - no hacking just brute force. Both builds were incredibly fun to play and gave the game a fresh feeling when tackling quests, missions, and gigs. I feel like this is one Technical aspect CDPR really nailed - the combat starts out difficult, but as you grow in the game, your power also grows. It just feels natural, and makes it possible to focus on the main focus of the game - the story. There are combat bugs like I mentioned, but nothing that makes it impossible to play. \n\n\nSo how would I shortly assess this game? Well like I alluded to in the beginning - it's an \"unfinished masterpiece\". An RPG game which Core elements are absolutely stellar, but a game which Technical aspects falls incredibly short. To anyone with the hardware to run the game at decent graphical settings and framerate, I would recommend it. To anyone else, wait. Wait and see if CDPR will deliver on \"fixing\" the game after its lackluster launch. I never joined the hype-train and thus didn't have any expectations for the game. Even after the early reviews, I still bought the game, but I am glad I did. I've fallen in love with the story, characters, and world-design. The Technical aspects of the game do not out-weigh the positive Core aspects of the game for me.\nIt is one of the best games I've ever played, despite its glaring issues. Bittersweet, just like the story of the game. I happened to enjoy the game, but it\u2019s not guaranteed that you will. Take this review for what it is - one man\u2019s opinion of the game.\n\n\"Now let's party like it's 2023\". \n\n",

        "content": "First of all, it'll be tough to review this game without addressing the controversy. I'm not making the claim that the game is bug/glitch-free. I can think of 2-3 memorable glitches in 60 hours of playing this game, and none of them have put me out more than 3-5 minutes after reloading a save. They also cropped up in typically-extreme circumstances. In one case, while visiting Misty's store for the first time, I forgot to pause the game before going to work, and came back 9 IRL hours later to find V still standing in the same spot I left him, with Jackie stuck in the car and unable to move. I reloaded to the previous auto-save and was back in business a couple of minutes later. \nThere were a couple of other incidents which were easily solved in minutes through the use of the Dev console on the PC version of the game (an item glitching through a wall and being out of reach, etc). All of those glitches were roughly 10-20 hours apart and I had to search my memory to even remember some of them. \nPerhaps I'm lucky, or maybe the PC version of the game is just more stable. (My GPU is 6 years old so it's not my hot tech running circles around the last-gen console versions of the game)\nAll I know is that when millions of people play a game and upload footage, it's easy to make a 20-minute compilation of relatively rare glitches. My experience has been vastly different. \nAlso, in the latest 1.1 patch, I almost doubled my framerate without touching any settings. (granted I also did a fresh update of my GPU drivers which may have helped a little). The game is rapidly fixing it's flaws, thanks to that insane Polish work-ethic. \n\nNow, for the actual review. \n\nThe game is beautiful. Granted NC is pretty filthy, but it is the most beautiful filth ever rendered in a PC game. Every building and area of the game has it's own distinct character, and the level of detail, right down to the stickers/graffiti and mountains of trash, is beyond compare. If the game took 8 years to come out, it definitely shows. \nThere's also a fair bit of variety to the gameplay. Even in just the combat alone, I can think of a half dozen viable builds off the top of my head, which I discovered largely through trial and error, and with a few tips from a friend. If you want to create a fast, durable character with a shotgun that turns enemies in to a chunky red mist, you can do it fairly early. After level 20 or so, you can start adding body augmentations that can further help the play style, like smart rockets firing out of your forearm, or the mantis blades that chop people up in to bite sized portions. I've got a friend that uses a fairly stacked sniper build that can ping people through walls and shoot them in the head for massive crit damage, without ever entering a building. I'm currently running a build with a smart gun (skippy) that automatically aims for the head and is stacked with crit mods for outrageous damage (all viable without duplication glitches or console commands). I've barely touched the stealth side of the game because I've still got a few combat builds I want to try, and the gun-play is (so far) endlessly entertaining.\nThe writing and characters are also quite solid, although for spoiler purposes, I won't give away too much. Granted it's got a rather campy vibe in certain parts, but if you like/expect that style of writing and humour, you will be pleasantly surprised. In typical CDPR fashion, the lines between good and bad are blurred in the majority of decisions you make. If you're as invested as I am, you will lie awake at night and question your morals. I only just inadvertently caused a minor genocide in Pacifica and I'm writing this review to avoid confronting the fact that I'm basically a cyberpunk Hitler. \n\nThere are a few downsides, of course. The game isn't all sunshine and rainbows. It took me 3 separate playthroughs of the tutorial to fully understand a substantial amount of the games mechanics. They certainly don't hold your hand when teaching you how to play. You can also accidentally skip vital parts of the tutorials and wind up lost and confused at certain points further down the line. I would recommend paying close attention in the first 4 hours or so if you don't want to repeat the beginning of the game. \n\nMy other major hitch at the moment is having a dense map that still feels somewhat empty. I've walked past numerous street vendors selling food and haven't been able to interact with any of them. Also, the vast majority of NPC's have very limited interactions. (outside of essential characters, obviously). Granted, it does a much better job of making the city feel \"alive\" than most other games, but it's not quite on the level of something like GTAV/RDR2. Fingers crossed for a future patch that allows for more detailed interactions with the world around us. \n\nLook, at the end of the day, I'm having a great deal of fun in this game. It's easy to remember the bad aspects of a game, while totally glossing over the really good aspects that an amazing studio and dev team have created. While nothing in this world is perfect, CDPR was at least ambitious enough to try and be. While falling short in many regards, it's still leagues of other AAA games in many ways. \n\nDid they deliver on ALL of their promises? No... (RIP mantis-blade wall-climbing)\nBut did they deliver a kick-ass RPG-shooter that doesn't turn in to \"Bullet-sponge Simulator 2021\"? ABSOLUTELY. (*cough* The Division *cough*)\n\nControversy aside, this game has been an absolute blast to play. I would recommend this to anyone familiar with the Witcher games. If you're still skeptical after reading this, then wait for the GOTY edition to come out with all the DLC's and patches. Either way, make room for this game in your future :)",

        "content": "Yes we all know about the bugs. It's not the buggiest game I've ever played, but it's worse than Skyrim at launch.\n\nWhen things are running well it's better than what I expected going into the game. Driving cars is off for me, but I keep a controller hooked up for the driving bits, like I do for GTA. \n\nCombat is great. The hacking system reminds me of being a spell caster in other games. The weapons quickly become bland though as you get a few that are extremely powerful (cough widowmaker.. cough) and the rest just don't hold up. It could also be my playstyle. I dumped a lot of points into handguns then started swapping to different weapons as I found them more fun.\n\nThe character customization is pretty good, it's no skyrim though. You can respec your perk points, but it costs 100k in game and I find myself farming to fix mistakes I made going in new. \n\nThe writing and voice acting is amazing. There were two sidequests I did called \"Sinnerman\" and \"Happy Together\" that has stuck with me as some of the more emotional things I've ever seen in a game. Moreso than Heavy Rain's emotional story.\n\nAll in all, it's worth it. If CDPR fixes the bugs, even more.\n\n",

        "content": "The game is still riddled with random freezes after 1.1 \n\nI still cannot recommend it.\n\nEdit:\n\nOkay, so, the game no longer gives me black screens, whether that's by CDPR fixing a bug that gets ignored for AMD's mesa drivers, or nvidia fixed the mutable. It works now.\n\nSo I played it, a LOT more again, started over, of course.\n\nA few things, some of the problems are ingrained deeply, like police AI, traffic, people. These things are still very bad. They don't bother me, personally, but I felt it important to mention\n\nThe things that can be fixed, through patches or DLC are, for me, a lot more important.\n\nApartments, I want a lot of choices, both for picking the apartment, and decorating it. As things stand, you just have V's shitty apartment with no customisation.\n\nMetro system, taxi, etc. Whilst I don't mind fast travel as it is. I loved the scenes where Jackie drives me, or the Delemain, or even Judy  etc. I would love to have things like that in, being driven through Night City. Or flown, like the corpo start vehicle.\n\nShops, the world feels a bit barebones and empty. Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle, as they say. Most stores, even those with signs that say \"OPEN\" in neon letters, are always closed, or not even interactable. This makes it all feel a lot more shallow. There are food stands all over the place, but none of them actually sell you food. This needs to change. It's silly.\n\nBraindances. A big thing, within this world. Whole gangs and storyline is devoted to it. You see people on the street, or in bars watching these things. I purchased all Braindances I could find. Alas, outside of story missions (where BD's are an essential tool to further the plot) you cannot use them. Which is a huge shame.\n\nYou'll notice the things can get fixed easily.  \n\nThe game is very barebones at the moment. Is it what they  promised? No, not even close. It's still a pretty decent RPG, all things considered. But it has the potential to be so much more.\nThe story is good, it has problems, I don't like certain directions, or that my relationship with certain NPCs is tied to the story. I would love to say that outside the main mission you could just live your life, so to speak. But the vast majority of side missions are the same. If they keep building on it, and adding to it. RPG things, relationships, customisation for everything, apartments included, more unique side missions with story elements. The ability to roleplay, make your own narrative. Then this game -can- be one of the best games ever. As it stands though, it's decidedly average. With a lot of untapped potential, but it's good, and playable. So I can now recommend the game, at least. Even on Linux (which is what I play on, it's ironically faster for me then on Windows now.)",

A lot of the problems I encountered a year ago have been fixed and improvements were made. \n\nStill a bit bitter about the complaints below, but Cyberpunk is a solid game and I struggle to ignore a good time when I see one.\n\n4/5/21:\nI have been reading new info on this game from the publisher and elsewhere, and it does not instill confidence in me that the removed features from the promotional materials will make their way into the game.\n\n1/24/21:\nThis game is a mess. From the cars in traffic that simply run you over if you cross the street, to objects clipping into the world, and not being clickable (especially when they are in the grass). The marketing had this excellent gallows humor to it, and even before booting up the game all of the wild videos betray the game you eventually end up playing.\n\nThere is something there in this game that could become something, but it ultimately is just a sad attempt at a Ubisoft open-world action/adventure.\n\nThere is only 1(?) apartment to own, cars can be bought but never modded. Even the system for purchasing them is tedious and completely boring. \n\nAdditionally, I think this game is the nail in the coffin for the \"RPG\" title for me. Sure, there are RPGs out there, but I believe that most action-adventure games have RPG elements in them. So it strikes me as a silly marketing ploy.",

        "content": "An amazing game under-minded by poor management. \n\nI had an outdated gaming pc when I first bought this game on release, and like many others, was disappointed on the horrible state it was and still is in. However, I wasn't disappointed because the game was bad, because it's not. What the game IS however, is poorly optimized and underdeveloped. THAT is what disappointed me. I then, a few weeks later, decided to play on Geforce Now, and afterwords built a good gaming pc that could handle it. Though I haven't completed the game I was and still am captivated by how beautiful it looks, the great voice acting, gameplay, characters, and the story. I'm about a quarter way through the game and I can safely say it's one of the best RPG experiences I've had in a while. \nIn all honesty though, this game needed at least 5-8 more months (maybe even another year) for it to be fully polished. Their first mistake was giving a release date. Their second, creating huge expectations. I'm sure if that it were up to the Devs, they wouldn't have released it like this and would have waited. So I can't fault them for it too much. \nRegardless of who you want to point fingers at the fact remains, that only a small chunk of the gaming community (like me) are able to truly enjoy this game right now, while the rest paid $60 for a trip to Bug city. If you haven't bought it yet but would like to, I'd say wait until it's optimized and playable if your system can't handle it. If you have it but can't get it to run or can't afford to drop $2,000 on a pc then I suggest using Geforce Now to hold you over until you do. Or just beat the game through that and call it a day (may save more money that way). \n\nTL;DR:  The game is good but needed more time in development. Only the people who have the Specs to run it are able to enjoy it right now. Either wait for patches for it to be playable, Use Geforce Now to compensate, or Buy a good pc if you REALLY want to play it right now.",

The characters are actually the best part of the story - some real gems to be found, for sure. Gunplay was good fun, melee was pretty meh, the hacking was alright.

I didn't have anything game breaking during my playthrough, just T-poses and random drops in FPS as something somewhere did something to someone or something somehow in some way that caused an issue... Overall B- , but could easily go to A+ if they crush the bugs.\n\nEDIT: I return from the future! The future is dark and vaguely CyberPunk like, Odd. Anyways, I'm updating this to an A++ they have thoroughly crushed the bugs. GG",

These how ever are set to be fixed as well as free dlc given and more content to be added later down the road. I think if everyone will give CDPR a chance they can redeem this franchise. Also CDPR should support modders as much as possible. Modders will most likely make this game what it should have been, and keep people happy with content while CDPR make a Cyberpunk 2177 or something if they choose to continue making more which they should because the one thing this series has is a ton of potential. The investors just really need to shut up and let devs work, also devs need to not promise more than they can deliver, and fans need to not claim to be mad about crunch, but then start wining with a game this big should take more than 8 years to make properly. A review is coming soon on my channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClhtfieovo1HtFRcPWOdDmg if you're interested.",

        "content": "Update for 1.5x patch: Still a buggy mess alas; stuff vanishing when you turn round, trains of cars still appear in the middle of the desert, characters spinning around in cut-scenes etc... There are 'less' issues now, but the base of the game is still deeply flawed and unsatisfying - and taking this long to add really basic stuff like in-game character customisation that should have been in at release is just not good enough.\n\nBy now, you've probably already heard about the bugs in this game, I won't go over those except to say: it is still VERY buggy, even at the time of the current patch 1.1. The bugs may not be as obvious as they were at launch, but they are still there, and in large quantities.\n\nTo quickly summarise for those who don't like to read: once you have finished the main story, you are left with what is in essence a reskinned Grand Theft Auto V with no multiplayer, no sense of humour, and a bunch of game mechanics that are a hindrance to your enjoyment of the setting. \n\nThe city itself looks great, the art style overall is really good especially the cars. The content within is like a nerd's techno sex-fantasy, the outfits are straight out of a BDSM magazine (all shiny and skin-tight), the atmosphere is one of complete sexual deviancy which the billboards all over the city keep reminding you. I mean, the first time you see some of it, yeah, it's quite funny, but seriously 'Milfguard'? A thousand variations on sexual performance enhancements? Whoever thought up some of this seems to be a pubescent William Gibson or Piers Anthony fan. It feels like it's trying to be funny, but then it's not, and is actually taking itself seriously, very seriously. There's no objectivity shown here at all, if this is CDPR's vision of a dystopian future then I'm just embarrassed for them, it's childish and puerile.\n\nThe story is okay, it has a few alternate endings, some of which make more sense than others. The Keanu Reeves performance is typical for him, it's mostly deadpan with some good moments. The other performances from the voice actors etc is pretty good. The material is really predictable however, and it's very difficult to get attached to any of the character's predicaments outside of your own (and that's because you have no choice on your own path). Some of the set piece combat/stealth missions are pretty fun the first time. There are also a bunch of potential sex scenes (which you can't skip btw), so if watching some really bad animated sex is your thing then there's plenty for you to rub one out to.\n\nOne of the big things that CP2077 was hyped up for was it's character creator. Well, yes, you can customise your genitals, if you can call having three options for each gender customisation. This 'customisation' is the theme of the whole thing, there's no sliders just a bunch of presets for various attributes: nose, eyes, jaw, and so on. And whilst 30+ hairstyles might seem a lot, it's actually more like variations on 3 or 4 styles plus bald. You also get tattoos, for face and body, 4 or 5 choices for each and no way to change the colours from a dark sickly green. There are no body shape options here either, so if you wanted to make a fatty from 2001AD then you are out of luck. You can get some good looks from it, but ultimately they all feel the same.\n\nIn conclusion, if you remember the launch of No Mans Sky, then it's worse than that. NMS had the game but not the content when it launched, and has now matured into a great all round game. CP2077 has the content (just) but not the game, and I have no hope that without a complete rewrite of the basic game mechanics that we'll get any more from this than just a bunch of bug fixes and some opening up of closed areas in future DLC. \n\nJust avoid, you can be disappointed at your own sexual performance IRL without also watching it unfold in a game.",

Ending is literally the WORST part of the game it make no sense in any way and fucks up your hopes and thoughts about \"What if i pick this what will happen or that what may i lose\"  it's totally unrelated to what will happen because it is ALWAYS THE SAME FUCKING ENDING (except for 1 which if you have 1 iq or higher you prob won't pick that because it is not a good ending for anyone's life at all). I don't really care about bugs since i haven't seen many in my play time but there are hell of it just to letting you know also there are so many i mean A SHIT LOAD OF dialogues that you get an answer or reaction that is totally out of context of the situation that you are in which fucks up the mood of the scene or the story. One last thing if you care, if you select a female body then you are fucked because you are never gonna get the one of the BEST(!) endings if have picked a female character which is totally bullshit and i am here saying this a male and i played 95% of  my game time as male this is stupid.Anyways FUCK ppl who thought Witcher 3 was long and Cyberpunk 2077 shouldn't be that long and FUCK CPR workers who LISTENED to this BULLSHIT",

        "content": "One of the buggiest AAA games I've ever played if you don't count all the Ubisoft games. I didn't believe in the hype which most of the people seem to have bought with blue eyes. We've been lied by gaming companies for years in E3 presentations and reveals, so why should we believe hype. Has there ever been a game that lives up to the hype 100%? It's like here in Finland where we know that snow will come at some point during winter, yet every year we are taken by surprise when the winter finally comes.\n\n\n Cyberpunk 2077 is  an open world game where if you go explore the open world you find bugs, glitches and break the game.  Even though I didn't really encounter any of the game breaking bugs there were times that some bugs really frustrated me during some side missions. Speaking of side missions there is story related side missions with real content and then some \"fetch this\",  \"kill this\" \"steal that\" kind of missions that are boring and just there to fill the world.  I left most of those undone after my 128 hour playthrough of the story.  And I won't be playing this again until there is more content.\n\nThe life paths seem like you were supposed to pick street kid and progress through the ranks to corpo and then end up as a nomad. The game is full of potential that was wasted to make Johnny's Porsche look as authentic as possible and adding pointless youtubers and twitchers in the game.  \n\nFortunatelly for the game the story is good and saves the game. Even though it feels a bit rushed and it lacks the urgency the story want's you to think there is. \n\nThe game needs patching and while it works on PC if you have proper hardware and not some ancient things you run Fortnite on, the game just isn't worth the price at the moment. Maybe after they release few patches, the promised free dlc that hopefully adds lots of the missing and cut content it will be worth the price.\n\nSo If you have decent enough computer and are willing to spend money on an unfinished game that might bring you enjoyment then go ahead by the game I recommend it to you. But if you lack the decent hardware and can't stand on buggy games. Well just go and play those graphic hentai novels. I don't really care. I liked the game well enough to actually recommend it here in Steam.",

Story is fairly immersive, with a good amount of side-quests to complete. Also, there are various gameplay approaches that are all feasible to play the game; meaning if you wanna use melee weapons (your hands, baseball bat, an electric baton/club etc) to bash in your opponents head, go right ahead. Sneak your way with silenced weapons and come from behind? Sure! Use 'hacks' and inflict damage to your enemies? no problem. Guns blazing?? F**k Yes!",

This game is breath taking. It's an awe filled work of art I'll be talking about for years to come. ... Bugs? *Me Shrugs* Nothing is perfect. Are you? No! You're not, so calm down.

The only thing that is a bit hard for me to adjust to is the driving, the mechanics/physics seem a bit off. Overall i'm beyond pleased with this game and have it on multiple platforms.

There's plenty of little things to find and do, as well as multiple ways to play for all sorts of different endings.",

Honestly, that's kind of the case with so much of this game: I wish they would have gone deeper and let you have more than just surface interactions with Night City and NPCs. They created this huge city but for all that work and for all that you see, you only just start to interact with it on a truly meaningful level. I really liked this game but I just think it could have been so much better and I can't help but feel disappointed about that. It's like having an incredible new sports car you can't drive past 50 MPH.",

        "content": "It's an unfinished product. I'm in my third playthrough with over 180 hours of gameplay and I've explored almost every spot in the game. I've noticed that a lot of things were left accessible without any purpose, some areas that lead to a pitfall into the void and some stories are left without a conclusion. Those aspects of the game are either left unfinished or have been removed. I'm getting the idea that the project was mismanaged.\n\nMany scenes which would have had a stat-check like in the videos presented by CDPR have been removed. Areas blocked off by an invisible wall for developer convenience. Unkillable characters for unknown reasons.\n\nYes, I would have liked to kill Meredith Stout, explored Biotechnica, ripped the gorilla arms off of any dumbass gonk (idiot in C2077 jargon) and heck, even refuse doing the Dex heist. All of this, is possible without breaking the main questline and the game, but it's not available to the players because...? We don't know. Due to the lack of openness from CDPR, the community is left to wonder about the future of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThe main storyline is beautiful but inconclusive. The game mechanics are fun but glitchy. The overall experience is fantastic but at the same time, frustrating. I cannot recommend this game because CDPR promised something and did not deliver it to the standard of that promise. It's unfortunate but I strongly suggest they, CDPR, forget making the game playable on console and focus on finishing the game on PC.\n\nAvoid this game. It's not ready yet.",
