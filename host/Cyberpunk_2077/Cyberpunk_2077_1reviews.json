The hype and anticipation leading up to release, alongside the game itself, all started to fly apart at the seams and come crashing down. It quickly became clear that it wasn't ready for release - it was riddled with bugs and issues that left a sour taste in the mouths of gamers. CD Projekt had taken their eye off the ball and dropped it massively, landing themselves in a hole from which there may have been no redemption.\n\nBut they never gave up on the game, nor did a number of fans and now, 2 years later it has redeemed itself and is what it should have been back at launch day. With many bugs squashed, quality of life improvements added and a lot of technical issues resolved (though there are still some lingering issues and it's quite demanding on hardware), you can slip into Night City and enjoy a rich, diverse story while roaming around to make allies and enemies alike. With the announcement of an expansion and a full fledged sequel on the cards, Cyberpunk 2077 is finally getting the recognition it deserves after a labour of love.",

The characters are likable while being realistic, especially with the immersive conversations you can have with the NPC. \n\nStill, the game itself does have some issues. Occasionally the game will get stuck trying to do basic things like blocking you from jumping to another level if your too close to the wall. Sometimes it'll start a phone conversation while another NPC is trying to talk to me. These are just some examples of things they could improve on with new patches. \n\nOverall, I would say that there is room for improvement but the game really is amazing. Cyberpunk 2077 is a very ambitious game and as long as you can get passed the small issues it has then you will love the game. It has absolutely been one of the nicest games I've played and deserves some love for the story and the details they've included into the game alone.",

The characters are fantastic and their dialogue is top-notch. \n\nIt definitely had a rocky start, but its nowhere near where it was at launch. I would say 99% of the bugs I saw when the game first released are gone. Are there still bugs? Yes. But they aren't impactful to your game whatsoever, usually its just an NPC going through a closed door or something.\n\nI picked this game up while it was 50% off a couple of months ago and here it is 50% off again (at the time of writing), the game goes on sale often and if you have been interested to play it I would definitely pick it up.",

I was really hyped for this game, but with the launch state worse than the first SpaceX launches, I decided to just put it down and wait for the fixes. \n\nMind you, I didn't had any technical issues, just ONE crash while trying various settings and having a taste for the game (BTW, THIS is how you handle in-game settings and loading times, R*) . \n\nAnd glad I waited, because now the game is, dare I say, in it's prime. Not only the game itself is quite polished, but with Edgerunners anime, it's having a renaissance in the average gamer's mind. AND there's a big expansion coming with even more updates from CDPR. \n\nIt's a good time to jump in indeed.",

As he climbed up the ladder of the merc reputation, he was offered a high tiered job which is both challenging and one that changed his live. Maybe forever.\n\nThis is my second playthrough on Cyberpunk 2077. The first one I played on the PS5. I 100% the game but I felt its better to play this with Ray Tracing + High framerate + Keyboard and mouse. I wasn't wrong.\n\nThe graphics is insane if you have at least a RTX 3080 with Ray Tracing turn to full blast. Almost every moment seems like a good time to activate the photo mode. \n\nI've never played RPG shooter before this, so the gameplay is a little odd to me. The fact that it can take a couple of headshots to kill an npc seems ridiculous in my opinion.\n\nAdding to the weirdness, you can spend a lot of time customizing your character but you'll hardly see your character since its in first person view most of the time. Except when you're riding a bike and change the camera mode to third person. \n\nOverall, its a replayable game. I feel the main quest is kinda short, so take your time with the side quests while in the middle of the main quest.",

        "content": "[h1] Cyberpunk 2077 - A good game, but with its flaws [/h1]\n\nA game that is very good, but still has its flaws, leaving it far from perfect, let's start with the positives: \n\n[olist]\n[*][h1]Graphics; [/h1]\n\nThe game has very good graphics, and has a wide variety of scenarios, really immersing you in a cyberpunk world, passing from the city to the desert, always well detailed, most often played in high quality (and for medium period, will be explained later when I talk about bugs) \n\n[*][h1]Gameplay: [/h1]\n \nA good first-person rpg , plus the non-perfect gameplay, at some point realize that the enemies are not very intelligent, giving the impression that the same enemies, changing only appearances, still has a diversity of weapons and ways to play, it is worth noting that one notices the affection of the developers for the game. \n\n[*][h1]Sound: [/h1]\n\nWell, that one point partly negative and partly positive, the dubbing of the game is excellent (this in my root language than Portuguese), but on the other hand the weapons are insufficient at some points, you do not feel the sound difference between weapons of the same type, seeming that the best has no difference from the weakest. \n\n[*][h1]History: [/h1]\n \nWell this part and very complicated, because honestly, the story and some points and very weak, what saves her and the character of Keanu Reeves, without Johnny Silverhand the history  of the game would not hold, it is worth pointing out one thing, different from the main story the side quests are wonderful, because that was they managed to make me care about an Artificial Intelligence of cars and  a vending machine,  a story that telling most side quest provided me with almost 60 hours of gameplay. \n\nGood going through these points that I consider the best, but also  are not perfect, but now we go to the worst part, the BUGs. \n\n[*][h1]The BUGs:[/h1]\n \nGood this is a delicate point, because even after 2 years of release the game still has bugs, but as I did not play at launch I cannot compare, just say my experience. \n\nSo yes I had some bugs and some really messed up the game, in some moments key mission characters got stuck on the ground, but just carried a save that solved, but let's talk about the bug that messed up my first 20 hours of gameplay that simply made it impossible for me to play with the graphics above average,  because when entering the inventory or even the pause menu when returning to the game it was locked at 14 Fps, the only solution was to put in the medium because so it did not happen anymore, it is worth noting that I started playing in version 1.6 is this bug was fixed at 1.61, that way the next 30 hours of play I could play with the graphic at the top and with an average of 55 Fps,  this all in FullHD ultrawide. \n\nApart from this bug, the others even did not get in the way so much, more to say that the game is without bugs would be an exaggeration. \n\n\n\n [h1] Final considerations: [/h1]\n\nCyberpunk 2077, a game that promised a lot and failed to deliver everything, but that does not make it a bad game, it is rather a good game, however  it is insufficient in some points, it and a good game, more is not perfect, more and able to make you have fun without a doubt. \n\nA good game, with a story even having its problems and comes captivating, 2 years after launch and a game that I recommend, and buying in a promotion of 50% is very worth it, here in this analysis is my recommendation.",

I just bought the pc version here on steam yesterday, and I was amazed. Coming from the PS4 version to this is almost a huge leap. Playing at 60 fps with no glitches, (other than some caused by my tinkering with graphics) I'll say it's a real treat. I've been fully immersed and i'm more excited than i was at launch to experience this game. The world is beautiful even without ray tracing turned on. The characters are interesting with detailed models and the gameplay is solid enough to keep me happy. Typing this now, all I can think about is jumping back into V's shoes. I'm extremely happy with it and can't wait to see what CDProjektRed has in store for us in the future.",

The main npcs are really well done and the story is good. Like in Witcher 3, there are alot of unmarked quests and cool things to find exploring that you will never see if you don't take some time and wander around. If you blow through the main story you'll miss most of the best stuff.  I just wish I could play the game they designed before they cut so much stuff.",

The game have gotten alot of bug fixes and updates since then and is better than ever and will get even better with future updates and DLC next year. \n\nWith the added transmog option (should have been there from the start though) you can finally play the true CP2077 endgame, hunting for new outfits. \n\nThe game also offer some truly amazing enviroments that are perfect for all the virtual photographers out there. \n\nShould you buy it?  Well that is something you need to figure out yourself, but with close to 500 hours played as of writing this I am surely enjoying my time with this game and look forward to many more hours.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Very fun game, I would describe it as a futuristic version of GTA with a much better combat system, much better story, much better graphics, and way more dialogue/world building. This game is extremely dialogue heavy, so be ready for that. I usually like to play games without sound so that I can listen to YouTube/audiobooks as I play, but that isn't suggested for this game since there are such immersive stories. I have a pretty high end PC and the game played very well for me with few bugs, better performance than Elden Ring. Most likely the prettiest game I have ever played, with the best graphics I might have ever seen. Game can be a bit jarring at first because you have to do a lot of tutorials, and the combat system isn't very fun. Once you learn the complex game mechanics and you can upgrade your cyberware, the game gets really really fun and you can mow down huge groups of enemies effortlessly. \n\nI played the game only because I really liked the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners series that just came out, and I seriously recommend watching that as well. I'd say that the series is better than the game, but the game is extremely interesting/unique in this game as well. Main story of the game can lag a bit at times, but makes up for it later on. Side missions are better than any game I've ever played and almost feel like part of the main story. Gonna have to play Witcher 3 after this at some point too.",

The romance is pretty shallow,[spoiler] as you do a couple missions and then have a sex scene, which just puts you into a relationship.[/spoiler] Most of the small problems you might have, like maxing your level too fast or enemies dying too quick can be fixed with mods very easily, as they added a modding platform to the game.

        "content": "This game had a really rough start. I followed it very closely and recently got it, not because I didn't want a buggy game, but because I had a 1050. This GPU really shouldn't be used for such a master piece, so I waited for a new GPU. This game is by far my most favorite game, from the story about how you determine and change your future as V, to the gameplay styles that suits nearly every person. The game isnt the longest if you just play for the main story, but that is because CDPR (the devs) said the previous game, The Witcher 3, was too long, and not many completed it. There is not many issues at all I have with the game, it feels like other games I played before, i mean, Skyrim and Fallout 4 really wasn't the smoothest and still had bug with mission messing up and crashing.",

In spite of the originally buggy release it's clear that CDPR cares about this game, this IP and they are continually adding fixes and actively supporting the modding of this game. Speaking of modding it is refreshing to see devs who are fostering that skill in their community which makes the games better and helps them envision what kinds of things we want to see in future games with this setting. There are times that it can still be quite buggy, but for the most part the game runs fairly stable and especially given how it's on sale as of the time of writing I can absolutely recommend dropping something on it to give it a go. The stories and attention to detail in this game are phenomenal if you pay attention and it's clear that this is a game that has had a lot of passion put into it.",

Too bad the game had such a controversial release when they practically rushed it out. If they would've launched it in the state it is today it would've been a whole different story. Meaning I would've paid full price and not wait for a sale. But in the end it's not all about the money from my perspective, it's about the state of the game when it's released to the public. I've learned from Bethesda to never ever ever pre-order anything anymore. Luckily, CD Project Red did get it right after a couple of major patches. Hopefully they've learned their lesson, if you want your game to thrive you'd better keep your promises. Otherwise you might get sales at a low price or not at all.",

As for now that the game is on a \"closed-beta\" level I will say buy it but not on full price. Gameplay and story is marvelous. The story is in the same universe as the edgerunners but is not the continuity you are searching for, the story is not the same. Has plot twists here and there and character development feels real. Customization has more options than any other game I've played so far, thats a plus. There is a lot more to say about this game, has a lot of content, the loot seems unlimited, the collectibles are all nice, and it exhibits all the aspects of a good open world game.\n\nThe negative side is the remaining bugs. And I'm not talking about the things you will experience in the open world, those are hilarious, and are now features. The bugs YOU will hate, are the story based ones, where you cannot proceed because something didn't spawn, for example. But the save system is just like skyrim so you will have multiple points of coming back. \n\nOverall i value the game at 30EUR, with score 9/10. Liked it a lot.",

On GOG I rated this game 1 fkn star because (sry not sry) the bugs man, THE FKN BUUUUGS! I played on EVERY possible version sincer launch hopeing it would fix some major issue, but not... 3 months since i last played on GOG and version 1.61 released, and me being a fool thinking \"oh they didnt fix it with 1.5 the \"HUGE\" update, maybe, just maybe this time with 1.6 they will\" but guess what, same shitty and annoying game crashing bugs. \n\nBottom line, ill still play cuz im an achievement freak and beacause the story is AMAZING! BUT(t): the perfomance drops/problems (i have a 3060 ti) and bugs are making me rate it 1 star, this fkn game feels like early access still now, it amazes me how they can release such a title and still claim its fixed. What a waste of a project and possible great game!\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention another reason I play, is MODS! They fix the game on some parts and ADD what fkn CDPR cut from the game (if you search for the best mods out there), more action, cops chases/battle with cars/bikes, balances, companions (mutiple at a time), flying cars!!!, unlocked level cap, adjustable in-car first person camera, recipes for more item crafting, everything that shouldve been there in the initial release that they decided to cut or to release unfinished/with bugs. \n\nMaybe V5.0 will be better :)",

No, there are visual bugs that will occasionally remind you you're not actually living in Night City, but in over 100 hours of play I never encountered anything game-breaking.

The game is beautiful, and it has a lot to offer. Plenty of story and a plethora of skills and pathways to choose from to play your way. The game really can be played a variety of different ways, and at whatever pace you choose. This, in turn, gives the game replay-ability. Love it!",

People will either dislike it, just for the sake of the poor launch and other things that could've been done better, or will fall in love.\n\nI personally fell in love all the way. I've always been a fan of cyberpunk/future dystopia concept or art, so this game pretty much hit the sweet spot for me.\nYes, there are still some issues, bugs and glitches in the game, several things that could've been done better and properly, the game's also missing some mandatory features as standard such as for instance vehicle customizations or access to different kinds of transport, etc... Simply things that would make this game even more GTA-ish, if this game is supposed to be the rival for GTA.\n\nBut what this game is mainly all about and what I love about it, is the atmosphere it produces, the emotions, the story, the characters and their individual stories, the dialogues, the neon world, the music and much more. This game makes you feel things. It dragges you into this world in a beautiful and sinful way. The size and depth of this game is also great, I've played many hours in this game and still feel like I barely explored the half of it. The music and soundtrack in this game is one of the best I've listened to, if not the best - fits the game perfectly and highlights all the emotions and atmosphere.\n\nIf you're a fan of this world like me, you're gonna forgive the game all the issues and mistakes and just will have a blast.\n\nHave a good day & have fun chooms!",

There're a mountain of side quests that will have you moving all around the city with various methods of completion for each. The game gets a bit broken when you have the gorilla arms and the jump legs (can't remember what they're called), but it's all the better for it. I haven't played on the harder difficulties, but even the normal game is fun. Can be a bit repetitive but if you variate between the main quests and the side quests, it breaks up just fine. I somewhat wish they went Crackdown on it, making your character capable of even more unreasonable feats of physics, but I'd probably regret having skyscraper height jumps and atomic bomb punches. It's just fine as is. And all the people coming to it as a result of watching Edgerunners is a needed boost of attention for it.",

Very enjoyable, but also very very flawed.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is a Pros Cons list\n\nPros:\n- Big map\n- Lots of activities to do\n- Great Combat\n- Amazing Customization\n- Wonderful characters and writing and voice acting\n- Amazing Graphics (if your PC can actually run those great graphics, however I ran at the lowest settings and it still looked awesome)\n- A story that's surprisingly emotional\n- Great combat\n\nCons:\n- Stealth (if you don't use netrunning that is, which is what is intended, but throwing knives are SUPPOSED to feel like an alternative\n- As soon as you finish a character's story, they just kinda become a background NPC . . . no more unique interactions, nothing, unless they're a love interest in which case you'll get texts every once in a while . . .\n- Feeling as if you're dying the whole time can get . . . pretty annoying\n- Glitches are still present, most are just visual, but there are a few functional ones as well, like occasionally not being able to activate your Operating System like Sandevistan and Berserk, even when the cooldown is already finished\n- Your choices don't feel very well, varied. Although V as a character is not very set in stone before you the player come along, it feels like your choices aren't very impactful of the world as a whole, or to who V is as a person. In contrast to The Witcher 3, a game with a protagonist with plenty of established lore, that game allows you a wider array of actual choices\n- Sometimes content feels repetitive\n\nNow as a note, a lot of these cons are only something you notice roughly 50+ hours in anyways. So, who knows.",

        "content": "I've seen some people saying that patch 1.05 turned the game around and that it's far closer to what was promised. That's pretty amazing to me as I started on patch 1.06 and it is still an incredibly glitchy mess. In many areas it still feels incredibly rushed. Including the big finale. \n\nBy the end of the game combat would fail to exit when the last enemies were dead half of the time. So it happened a [i]lot[/i]. Gameplay menus such as inventory would all be disabled when it happened, too. Had to load a save to get out of it.\n\nNPCs would sometimes start glitching where every frame would alternate between them t-posing and in the correct position. Producing a rather unpleasant shimmering effect.\n\nItems, most notably [i]proximity mines[/i], sometimes are under solid ground so that you can't see them normally. You can only see them by scanning icons. If you happen to be approaching a minefield, scan early or you might just blow up from a mine that's invisible unlike the rest in the game.\n\nYou can walk right into a couple areas that are supposed to be inaccessible at that point. You can't get out of them though, you have to load a save. \n\nThe game is also desperate for a flashlight. Some areas are completely unlit. Shouldn't have to crank the gamma just to navigate a room.\n\nAnd the big secret ending? Without spoiling, it literally hard cuts from moping to combat. No building tension or anything. Mass Effect 3's ending was done better than this.\n\nBasically, only the prologue missions are worth playing. And if you've seen the game trailers and are familiar with other cyberpunk content, then you've already done half of that.\n\nWorst of all: When you get the cat, you can never interact with it again. Doesn't even move, just spawns in a different spot in the apartment and meows forever from that spot until you leave.",

I've always been a fan of the GTA series and the story here is more in depth. The RPG elements are great too allowing you to completely dictate your play style. The soundtrack is also the best music from artists you never heard of before and I am now fans.\n\nIt's completely cheesing the game, but going netrunner and quickhacking everyone eliminating them without even stepping foot out of your car amuses me greatly.",

In the first two days of owning it I already had 36 hours in and it  was beautiful. Even for weeks after this was basically all I played. The characters were amazing and you couldn't help not to get attached to them. The stories were amazing and engaging even some of the really small side quests (Always play the side quests. you will gain a greater understanding and context of the world and what is happening.)\n\n My wish for something different and unique had come true and I constantly want more, not only of the series but the cyberpunk genera. (ex: Ghost runner, Ascent, Ruinner, etc.) not a lot of games are able to grab me for absolute hours on end, not since Skyrim on xbox360.\n\nI was happy with my purchase then and I still am. I wish more people would give this game the change it deserves and fall in love with it like I did. ( I 358 hours for a reason and im still not finished playing.) I hope that both the series and genera continues to grow.",

        "content": "I think the best way to understand the appeal of this game is to look up the sort of youtube content that is made for it.  While there are some very good videos from around launch analyzing what there is in terms of story and themes, the majority of the content is showing off how effective a particular build is at murdering a building full of people.  One to two minute showcases of throwing knives in slow motion, cutting nameless gangsters to bits with katanas or using the hacking mechanics to make entire rooms of people kill themselves.  In all of these videos there is very little context to the murder, and as it turns out that is true of the game itself.\n\nThe majority of the content in this game that pretends to be an rpg and is actually just a riff on GTA is markers pointing to a building or an alleyway full of people to kill.  There is some effort put into making this fun, the base gunplay actually feels quite nice and there is enough depth to the character building to allow the player to customize their V to be the kind of murderer they want.  The problem is that the combat becomes trivially easy if you put any amount of effort into buying upgrades for your character.  The game turns into short bursts of identical looking violence, spread across an entire city's worth of map markers.  Perfect for short and stylish videos on youtube but not ideal for what is supposed to be a decently sized game.\n\nThere is a story in between all the boring murder this game fills itself with.  At times it can even be decent with some well written and well acted characters.  There are absolutely the ingredients for a smaller and much more focused narrative about a younger mercenary who doesn't want to die and the digital ghost in their head that's killing them.  I have a long list of gripes about how the actual story plays out but that's a much longer review.  What is there didn't end in a satisfying way for me and even if it had, the way the game is structured would have undercut it all the same.\n\nOn the subject of bugs, in theory the game is \"fixed\" now.  In practice there were no shortage of physics glitches and animation errors and other ridiculous issues.  The game crashed on me more then once, but thankfully never softlocked on me.  I'd put the level of glitchiness at around the level of Skyrim, which is still way too glitchy.  This game does not actually deserve the redemption that gamers have given it.\n\nTLDR: Useful as a murder simulator and not much else.  This could have been a visual novel and it would have been way better, cdpr plz unionizer.",

        "content": "Honestly, it's hard to re-play something you had initially no hope for, which hurt all the more considering I had pre-ordered the game and had though (like practically everyone else) that this game was going to be the be-all-end-all of games. After playing those initial 20 hours in 2020, getting a quarter of the way finished, I chose to uninstall the game and be content that I had wasted 60 dollars on yet another mediocre game. After seeing all of the negative reviews, all of the videos, I felt that I had nothing more to gain. After all, why care for something that was never good and would be never good.  \n\nThat's how it was until I heard an anime came out with the same name. I don't watch anime and have no positive or negative opinion on the show, but I thought that it was decent enough to warrant my attention to be put back on the game. There's something Cyberpunk as a genre that not a lot of other media has for me, and I see a lot of that charm now more as I've been introduced to a lot more of the genre as the years go on. Judge Dredd, Philip K. Dick, Altered Carbon, etc, I've read all of them and see a lot of that in Cyberpunk 2077. Clearly the game isn't a novel, but it does have some of the passion from those writers put into the game's story and setting. \n\nI don't think this game warrants game of the years, as it clearly isn't the type of game that sticks with you past maybe a couple of weeks after finishing, nor does it have the replayability of New Vegas, but it still is maybe worth getting in 3 to 4 years when it's on sale and you want a game to play while off work. It's not great, but it's not terrible either.",

Devs have slugged through the toxic nature of gamers and delivered on most of their promises and even included some new stuff to surprise us. I was new to this entire world when I started and now I am using slang in casual conversation with strangers. Am I nerd? Yup. Patience is a virtue when it comes to this. Devs. From me to you, this is your flowers. Love yah. You guys are great and the story was amazing. I truly cannot wait to see what you got next. \n\nI would suggest people give this a chance, on sale or otherwise. You won't regret it. The graphics look great, the combat is a lot of fun..especially late game..and there are a million ways to play. Devs you have created a cyberpunk for life. I hope this message gets to you.\n\nLater, chooms!",

Man have I been missing out.  Visually stunning and I find myself just wondering around Night City looking at all the detail that has been put in. The main story is pretty good with 3 separate life-paths to pick for slight variations but man.. the side-quests are where its at.. The pros & cons of your in-game choices and relationships you develop with the characters are well thought out and keep you addicted. Lots of player developed mod content available too on NexusMods so replays are even fun and exciting with a different twist each time. Cant wait for some new content to be released! I'm usually a multiplayer FPS gamer but this game really sucked me in. Highly recommend!",

I feel the best is yet to come, can't wait for the DLC.\n\nThe first person feel, the best graphics I've ever seen, the immersive city and world around it, enthralling story and insanely memorable characters. \n\nWhat are you waiting for choom?

However, Cyberpunk 2077 has gone too far the other way and is all about the story and less about the game play. Yes there are the glitches that afflict other games involving large volumes of NPC traffic and yes there are lots of side missions but if you want to progress the main story line, expect to be sat watching a LOT of dialogue.",

        "content": "[h1]TL;DR: Worth the money, on sale or off sale.[/h1]\nIf you were staying away from the game because it has a bad reputation, it has improved exponentially with each new patch and is only getting better.\n\nFirst, I just want to start by stating that I'm [b]not[/b] from the Edgerunners crowd, I tried to play patch 1.3... but ended up playing patch 1.5 when it released.\nSecondly, I have a little over 50 hours of playtime in the game as of writing this, if that helps validate my opinions.\nI got the game cracked and played it for about 12 hours before deciding to buy the game legit (which I do not, and will not regret).\nSince I started playing the game after multiple patches were released, [b]I experienced very few bugs in my 50 hours of play time... 3 to be exact[/b].\n(my hardware was probably to blame for one of them)\nThe vehicles are still a bit buggy, the driving needs work in general but other than that it is extremely playable.\nI was a bit apprehensive of updating to 1.6 (I played my cracked version of 1.52 for 18 more hours after I bought it on Steam, even going as far as beating the game once) but after finally deciding to move my save file over to Steam I realized there was almost no difference... except maybe a 5-8fps loss, which was disappointing but tolerable.\nThe story is pretty decent, the graphics are incredible when maxed out, FSR 2.1 is great for lower end systems, and the detail put into environments is impressive to say the least. IMO the gameplay is relatively hard to master and definitely requires a decent amount of quick thinking on your part. This game isn't something you can play mindlessly, roach race (the playable in-game arcade game) is though... which is a really cool feature. Photo mode is also something cool to mess around with occasionally, especially if you love virtual photography, and there are multiple play styles which are all unique and equally fun.\nOver all this is the best game I've played in a while, and it's certainly worth the month it took me to get the money to purchase the game.",

Sneaking around and throwing knives at unaware enemies felt great though.",

Recently, I spent 80hrs doing 95% of all the gigs, side quests and finished the main story line. Playing on PC i hardly noticed any issues, but there were still some minor bugs, although they did not render the game 'unplayable'. This game is fantastic! I love the open world, every part of NC was beautiful! an there's always lots of things to do to keep you going. As amazing as this game was for me, I wished the main story-line was a bit longer. I hope CDPR continues with this masterpiece an gives us more Cyberpunk in the future.",

I have updated my drivers, my OS, made sure i had the C++ x86 installed. I set any settings to default that I could. I meet the minimum requirements for the game as well and it runs fine if i skip the launcher. its the Launcher itself that wont run, and there is nothing I can do to fix the issue, and it would seem to be the case for anyone else who has this issue as well. Hell, ive even tried running them from the folder themselves, the launcher gives the same issue and the setup doesn't do squat. Clearly there is something that fucked up along the way and at a download speed of 4mb/s I really don't want to wait an entire day to reinstall the ENTIRE game to have a /chance/ of it possibly working.\n\nDont get me wrong, it runs if I SKIP the launcher, but I don't gain access to all of what the game has for content.\n\nTLDR: Despite everything the company has done for the game to try to fix it, the game is fine. The prelauncher however is what breaks everything, and if it wont work for you, the best option you got is to tell the launcher to F-off by using \"--launcher-skip\" without quotations in the general properties of the game in the launch options button.",

The writing is fantastic, the story is compelling, the characters (most of them) have such engaging depth.

It definitely isn't the 'best game ever' like many expected it to be, but I think if you like shooters, you'd enjoy this. It also still does have quite a few bugs however I have only encountered one that soft-locked me. Not worth 60 but if you catch it on sale I'd say it is worth buying.",

Sure ill still get some weird ones like guns staying in peoples hands during cutscenes or a couple things not loading in quick enough sometimes, but its all minor bugs. I started playing Cyberpunk because I wanted to watch Edgerunners yet also make myself familiar to the world again and it made the show feel that much closer to me. The game is just so atmospheric, beautiful, and unique. In a league if its own in that facet. The replay ability is great as well as the storylines. Im currently on my 3rd playthrough and it still draws me in. If you were hesitant to try it because of bugs or unsure if the game was worth your time, I can say without a doubt you will atleast have fun and maybe even get emotional.",

        "content": "This is a great game. It was very ambitious, things like full car customization and real interactions with police forces were never able to be fully fleshed out, wanting multiplayer etc. This game has seen enough success I am hoping we get another iteration in the future, hopefully with some hard learned lessons.\n\nI would 100% blame that on the fact that this game had the burden of straddling multi gen console releases on top of being one of those 'RTX' flagship games. That is so many systems, so many different configurations, and spread the development way too thin. \n\nOn release I actually never had any problems, I have a fairly uniquely configured Aorus laptop I got several years ago with great cooling and the following for reference:\n\nIntel(R) Core(TM) i7-8750H CPU @ 2.20GHz   2.20 GHz\nRTX 2070 (Desktop GPU, not a limited laptop one)\n1920x1080\nSSD\n\nDo I have everything on high? No, but I do have most on high settings. I do not have RTX Ray tracing on, I turned low particular settings that did not make much of a difference / do not occupy much of the field of view but have huge performance costs. And some of the post processing effects (some vignette effects stuff like that)\n\nHowever, since release I have played through it again with DLSS enabled, and that is a great piece of technology. Greatly increases performance and the background 'blur' actually simulates depth of field.\n\nA desktop with a better CPU and the same level of graphics card I imagine will run this game without a problem. I honestly think this game is not worth getting for console, even next gen.\n\nI have finished this game twice now and will again when the DLC comes out. I feel like you get enough power even if you spread yourself between 2-3 main attributes if you aim to complete the final mission around lvl 35. Not like skyrim where you really need to get through the skill trees 80% before you see any sort of benefit. And there are quite a lot of different playstyles supported by the combination of cyberware, weapon choices, melee choices, etc.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic, and Johnny Silverhand is great :)",

Unlike witcher 3 there is no great depth and things happening here.\n\nThe game was supposed to be about choices - THERE IS ZERO choices in this game - this is same as call of duty (Actually haven't played call of duty for like 5+ years so its possible call of duty has more choices than this), - the only choices here - it lets you select different dialogue options - those dialogue options do absolutely nothing, they don't even change the outcome of a scene.\n\nGameplay -... Well... I had as much fun playing this as when I was playing modded fallout 10 years ago. so by the standards of 2012 - the gameplay in this game is good.\n\nSkip this title.",

And I'm looking at a piece of art, a political wakeup call, a story about life and death, a story about friendship in a beautiful neokitsch world.\n\nI was hyped for this game, waited until I had the PC to play it, and I wasn't disappointed with the (few) small glitches I encountered. This game is a masterpiece, especially *right now*. Please, play it.",

I do not regret purchasing the game, however, it still has some outstanding issues.\n\nThe city does feel alive visually, and some parts of the game are story rich, but there are very few minor NPC interactions, which makes the world feel less alive. You're always heading towards some sort of objective, and while most video games do work like that, lacking such small distractions is a disappointment. Along with this, it's been over a year since release and there's still glaring performance issues. For reference I have an RTX 2080 Super, which isn't that good, but even on low settings I got semi-frequent stuttering, which caused the audio to also crackle and increase my headaches even further.\n\nI do enjoy seeing the progress they've made since launch, as it does seem to be doing much better than before, but with issues like these still in the game I really wouldn't recommend purchasing unless on sale. If you need a Cyberpunk aesthetic fix: watch the anime, or hell watch something like Cowboy Bebop.\n\n[h1]Numerical Review[/h1]\n\n[b]Graphics: 5/5[/b]\nNight City looks beautiful and dark, makes me feel like I'm in a rebel ghetto from Star Wars.\n\n[b]Story: 4/5[/b]\nThe main story is great from what I have played, and the side-gigs have fun little one-offs. \n\n[b]Gameplay: 4/5[/b]\nNot the most revolutionary thing, but body modification is always interesting. The whip arms (I forget the name) are amazing.\n\n[b]Performance: 2.5/5[/b]\nStill has performance issues even on low settings, which many others also have experienced.\n\n[b]Overall: 3.5/5[/b]\nGreat game, but still needs fixing up in a good few places.",

I\u2019ll admit they have fixed probably 80% of the bugs and the performance is better. So good job on that, But I still feel like the game doesn\u2019t live up to the hype from the devs.\n\nSure its a open world\u2026 but the world feels so empty.  Doesn\u2019t help that npcs all look alike. If you watch the original gameplay trailers compared to the actual game the world feels empty compared to the videos. The scenery is beautiful. If you can have the game run smooth lol. The fast traveling is okay.  After awhile you\u2019ll realize the world really isnt that big lol. The random encounters are okay but after awhile you realize it\u2019s the same shit over and over lol. Cops are a lot better now. Feels like the same system as gta.\n\nWeapons are copy paste. Same damn guns better starts. Sure you can get a couple unique weapons but ehhhh lol the hacking system is okay. But it doesn\u2019t make a big difference. Combat is okay. A little on clunky side. You\u2019ll be sinking whole clips of ammo into enemies if you just play it as a shooter. Snipers are you best friend. \n\nStory is okay. I cant believe it was the best story they could come up with. Specially with having reeves on board. It was kinda lackluster. The voice acting was great though by everyone. Props to the voice actors. The romance options was very disappointing. Took interest in some characters romantically  just to find out you can romance them lol. Bummer. \n\nAll in all the game was over hyped.its a decent game, but from all the videos ,Twitter post and dev updates. Its not what it we were promised. Another example of a game dev that just wants to push out a game no matter what state the game is in. \n\n",

The gameplay is nothing revolutionary or groundbreaking, but it's fine for the game. The support of mods also gave it extra spice and customization.\n\n[h1]\u3010Replay-ability: 6/10\u3011[/h1]\nThe lifepaths you choose make no difference to the world and story. However, the choices you make can lock away interactions, so it can be argued that a second run can be done to make sure nothing gets locked, and you can aim for a different build for another playstyle.\n\n[h1]\u3010Story: 9/10\u3011[/h1]\nThe stories and world-building are very detailed. Developers considered every part of the world and showed complexity and interactions between humans and machines. The quests have split paths that are hinted at to players through interactions. They are often obvious, but few are subtle. Decisions can change a quest, unlock secret endings, or even lock up interactions. I made a few mistakes and ended up being super paranoid and was doing research on every potential split to make sure I got the best results.\n\n[h1]\u3010Gameplay: 7/10\u3011[/h1]\nThe gameplay is nothing revolutionary. The driving is a little slippery, Enemies are so blind when I stealth. I move faster than NPC in quests. Some of these can be fixed with mods. However, there are still pros to it. You can play with different skill trees aim to make a specific part of combat extremely powerful. You will quickly end up OP if you follow a specific path when you level up. The unique weapon class like smart and tech weapons are interesting. Not to mention the cyberware that let you quick-hack or even slow time. It's very interesting.\n\n[h1]\u3010Visual/Style: 10/10\u3011[/h1]\nThere are so many details put into the game to convince me that it can be the future. Day-to-day items are reimagined to give off a high-tech vibe. The city design is also filled with unique buildings. I can just cruise around the game and take screenshots to use as later references for my drawing. It's very inspiring.\n\n",

        "content": "It is honestly a very good game. I like the world, the plot, the characters, the graphics. The world, in fact, is quite gorgeous and I can see that a lot of effort and design have gone into sculpting it. The possibility to romance some of the characters is fun, unique and in a way completes some of the dialog.\n\nThe game plays kind of like GTA, if you didn't already know that. The player is able to customize the characters appearance, traits, cyber implants, etc. make some difference in the play style. Some of the decisions and themes in this game are surprisingly grim. It's not all doom and gloom however, there are moments of sadness and beauty as well.\n\nPerformance wise the game is overall running great on 3080 and 5950x. There are some hiccups that oddly enough sometimes happen when navigating the menus. A restart of game fixes that but it's clearly a thing to be fixed.\n\nIt's a shame the game had a rough launch and was released in an unfinished state but what's there, at the time of writing this review on November 2022, is very well put together and I would have unknowingly done myself a disservice if I had not picked up this game. It took me couple of tries to get the hang of it but once the plot line bit me, I really started to enjoy the game. I hope the developers are able to pull a \"No Man's Sky\" and keep adding content into the game to make it even better. The recently added modding support is a great decision as mods will definitely prolong lifetime of any game.\n\nI'm hoping for more of Cyberpunk!",

        "content": "Everyone is familiar with how ridiculously overhyped Cyberpunk 2077 was. The expectation were so high that no game could realistically meet them ever - Cyberpunk was supposed to be THE definitive RPG, open-world game, shooter, adventure, experience, etc.\n\nOf course the expectations were not fulfilled. Exacerbating the issue were multiple technical problems, bugs and general lack of polish. Regarding those I am happy to report that at the time of this review's publishing the game mostly works fine. There's still some roughness around the edges, but barely any of the hilarity we witnessed on release remains.\n\nSo what about what this game is and what should you expect? This is a story focused open world first person RPG. The world is indeed open and freedom of traversal is absolutely there, but surprisingly enough I don't think this was a focus of Cyberpunk 2077. By far the strongest elements of the game are story, characters, quests and general atmosphere. In all honesty the \u0443\u0447\u0437\u0443\u043a\u0448\u0443\u0442\u0441\u0448\u0442\u043f character interaction, which is a huge part of the story anyway, is what makes this game. Voice acting, animations, dialogue and direction overall are very impressive. It is the process of getting to know the characters, forming relationships with them, growing to love or despise them and going through change together, that defines what it is like to play through Cyberpunk. The game will not show you its best if you approach it as an open world sandbox of sorts. Even the police chases are likely to disappoint you.\n\nAll this doesn't mean that the base gameplay loop is poor or lacking. I would characterize it as solid, easily above average yet not breathtaking. Exploration, leveling, side activities\u0431 inventory management and crafting all feel decidedly run-of-the-mill. One notable exception is combat. While not inspired in terms of how dynamic or visceral it feels, it gets elevated by the breadth of possible approaches. Those include stealth, both as avoidance and stealth kills, several schools of melee combat, close, medium or long range firefights with their respective weapon types and skill trees, and quickhacks which are essentially combat magic.\n\nOn the technical side this game is a resource hog. There is an optimized settings guide by Digital Foundry, but at any rate you will require at least a mid-range rig to enjoy the beauty Cyberpunk has on offer. But boy, does it offer! Character designs are excellent, the world is vibrant and at the same time appropriately dreary and feels lived in. All the modern tech is being put to good use of course. My only gripe would be repeating NPCs - they do not seem to be procedurally generated on the fly, but rather are summoned from an extensive library of pre-existing designs. It results in seeing same faces and same outfits here and there. Is this immersion breaking? I would say no, but the more demanding among us might disagree.\n\n\nAs for the sound, it is just plain decent. Not stellar but not subpar either. The score stands tall though - Cyberpunk has a lot(really a lot!) of great music and even boasts a number touching leitmotifs reserved for the story beats.\n\nLongevity wise I would expect a single playthrough to clock in anywhere between 60 and 120 hours and there is definitely some replayability easily warranting a second playthrough.\n\nOverall on the whole Cyberpunk 2077 is a very memorable and emotional journey. There aren't that many like this one. I am easily putting it right next to Undertale in my personal masterpiece rating, and it is not a crowded bunch.\n\nDo I recommend it? Yes, absolutely. Even those with only a passing interest in this project should consider getting it on a discount as every penny spent is well worth it in my opinion.",

        "content": "The game is super immersive and the game play is just the right amount of roll play with a clear distinction of us not being the actual protagonist. However there is one slight problem. The game still crashes constantly with no apparent reason. I waited to play this game for more than a year because of this but looks like they never got it under control. Great game though!",

        "content": "Played it for the first time about...2 months ago now I guess?   Using a chunky potato of a PC, and even still, it runs pretty good.  Yes it's got some janky bits, and some performance issues, but I honestly can't say that isn't because my PC is below specs.  BUT, I think it says a lot, that even on a PC that is below specs, with only a minor amount of graphics reduction, I run just fine about 95% of the time.  All those insane bugs the game was infamous for, I really rarely see any of them.  Seriously the game is WAY more stable than it was at launch.  So if your issue was the performance, which is the reason I delayed playing it for well over a year, I think you can safely play it without any real issues.\n\nNow, that disclaimer out of the way.  This game is really fun.  I love the amount of actual depth and story the plug into even the most minor of side jobs and gigs.  I'll be doing side quests and forget that this isn't the main storyline, but I forget because the writing and acting is so good, that it feels like I'm doing someone else's main story.  And then be like \"oh..right, this is just V going to the store for milk\"    The amount of effort and love the team put into this game, really does show.  From the various influences from the genre, that shine through in easter eggs and namedropping, to just the overall tone of the missions and events.  I've always been a huge fan of the cyberpunk genre, and so I was really looking forward to this game.  I'm actually not a huge CDPR fan, and frankly found the Witcher games to be very boring.   So I wasn't actually optimistic about this game when it launched.  But this is a very solid game, for anyone who is a fan of the genre.   I highly recommend it.",

There are good amount of issues in this game but despite them I found myself loving it. I just wish there was something to interact with post credit, especially considering I romanced Judy and the lack of care there seems to be for her after you black out from the whole well thing. \nIn the end I think this is a wonderful game that's worth your time if you're a fan of the Cyberpunk genre or are a punk yourself. This is a wonderful game and you should give it a chance if you can.",

        "content": "Pretty terrible release, everyone knows that. I played through the early buggy stages of the game close to it's release and found it to be quite the story driven masterpiece (at least by my personal standards, as well as in comparison to a lot of other big games). Game breaking bugs were very frequent, and the world felt empty as a whole every time i strayed from the main quest lines, because of course that was far more fleshed out than a large majority of the side content. My latest play through though, it was much better. I found myself enjoying this game even more the second time, which is no surprise following the many QOL improvements and patches to snuff out the glitches/bugs. Mind you bugs are still present, just not as prevalent. This play through was following the edge runners update. leaving the show out of the equation, this piece was greatly improved upon. The story still fantastic, i really look forward to a sequel, and hope the company execs don't subject their employees to the same 12-14 hour shifts as they did before. Love the game, highly recommend.",

It's plagued with bugs, skills and items are imbalanced and certain parts of the game feel unfinished. You can see a difference in quality in certain parts of the game compared to others. If this game released I would recommend it with the hope for improvements. But after almost two years this is unacceptable. Which is a shame because the cyberpunk universe is masterfully crafted, I love Night City and its characters, but the game makes it really hard to enjoy.",

        "content": "Written 11/19/2022 with 42 hours in the game. \nThe Story: I pretty quickly reached the point of no return for the main story around 20 hours ago and forced myself to back up and play a bunch of the side shit. Do this, it's worth it. The main story is far too short and gives you a sense of urgency that makes doing anything else impossible. In order to experience the full game, you have to break your immersion and pretend your character isn't *****. This sucks, but it's possible to get around it.\n\nThe Bugs: I've had to restart the game a few times when it got really fucked up. I feel like the small bugs build onto each other until you really can't handle it anymore and have to just save and restart. It's playable, sure, but you can absolutely get soft locked into certain situations and that sucks.\n\nThe Mechanics: Shooting is pretty good. Driving anything but the best cars is a shit storm unless you're going slow. Tech hacks are decently fun. The coolest part of this game is the way it makes you feel powerful as you gain more powerful cyberware, guns, cars, etc. It's a gritty world that I could see myself living in.\n\nMy Hardware: I'm running a Ryzen 5 3600x, GTX 1660, 16gb of good RAM, and NVME SSD. My monitor is only 1080p, 75hz, so I'm used to things not being *fancy*. The frames are doable on the recommended settings about 90% of the time. When it starts really slowing down, I'm usually in a super busy part of the map or have been playing for a few hours and need to restart anyways. \n\nConclusion: The game is fun. It's buggy, but the bugs are manageable 99% of the time. A restart has solved every major problem I've had. The story is too short and I doubt I'll be purchasing the DLC until it goes on sale. But if you can get the game for half-off like I did, I think you should play it.\n\nUpdate after finally finishing the story. It sucked. It made me feel bad for doing what I felt was the most selfless thing. I don't know, maybe that's just life. Play the game. Get your ending. Your choices matter, even though the game clearly wasn't even close to ready. It's still not. It's not a finished product and it never will be. I'm sad about it though, which shows impact.",

I romanced Panam, and it's cool how afterwards you get messages from her about random things, just everyday chatter. But it was very limited and I wished that there was more to do afterwards, a companion feature I feel should be in the base game even if its a little help in combat, or perhaps let them take the wheel as a sort of auto navigation, heck i don't think anyone would be made if you have a small *cuddle* scene- it just feels odd how you can be in a relationship with someone who is obviously keen for encounters but for the protagonist to have one the only way to provoke it is to pay a doll it, it just feels kinda dead and besides from the epilogue and credits nothing actually changes.[/spoiler]\n\n\np.s.\n[spoiler] who's idea was it to give the high tech stuff to fingers :))))",

        "content": "I love this game.\n\nFirst heard about it probably in 2019, as it was advertised in the Steam Store, anticipating it to come out in Spring of 2020. I thought it looked interesting, I've definitely been a fan of SF, but then wondered if it would be good, haha, tired of games trying to appeal to me with a theme. I saw some videos where people were talking about all the features in the game, sounded exaggerated I wasn't thinking you could do everything in the game, how is that possible in any game? Also, the wall-running made me dizzy in Titanfall 2 so I remember that part, I thought it could be interesting but I found it overrated in Titanfall 2 (turns out it was cut from Cyberpunk 2077 as many games cut content) I shrugged and added it to my wishlist. \n\nSo some delays, we found out why. And I was working security at a mall in a fancier neighborhood during the cold a$$ winter, getting very bored and lonely during the pandemic. So I got Cuphead for the Switch. That was some fun. Then I decided it might be worthwhile to check out Cyberpunk 2077, which was getting some buzz. I didn't know how, but I wanted to play it. I knew no way or would play any good on my PC. I got it on Stadia full price around Christmas 2020.\n\nThis game is so good. As someone who didn't follow it after its announcement in 2012, but instead around 2019, with skeptical interest, and played it at full power with bad Internet on Stadia (and some connection luck during the holidays), I thoroughly enjoyed the game. V's voice (the actress is in character, hence the rough quality to the voice), Jackie Welles, Goro Takemura, Panam Palmer... Even Johnny Silverhand during his a$$hole stages in much of the main storyline and to a lesser extent some of the side quests, I just love their voices and characters (Keanu as Johnny grows on you, he's an a$$hole for sure)\n\nAdvice for first playthrough, finish the side quests or gigs first, as much as possible and delay the main story as much as you can. There's nothing you have to do. Lots of interesting B-stories, take your time. I say this because I felt the suspense and wanted to get to the main story. I won't say it's a let down, but it's not what you expect, there's mystery and room for you to figure things out.\n\nIn the end the game made me realize that Judge Dredd, Akira, Blade Runner, Philip K. Dick stories, all this stuff I like is in the Cyberpunk genre. And the game with its gorgeous graphics represents it very well in the Blade Runner / 5th Element Style while being original (at least in my opinion, or original in a Shakespeare sense lol, a reworking of existing ideas)... Once you investigate Michael Pondsmith if you haven't before you see the genius he inspired in the tabletop Cyberpunk game and what a good adaptation Cyberpunk 2077 is of that. Probably many people know, but I didn't know, a lot of the videogame comes from the table top game. \n\nThen the playing style fits for me. I like shooters and cinematic style games if balanced well with gameplay. And humor, GTA games, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Origins, Valhalla, Black Flag and Far Cry games. I like RPGs too. Less patience for those. I think it's fair to call Cyberpunk 2077 an Action-RPG. Not a demanding game but a fun cinematic experience, kind of like a favorite SF series with some good action and environment from the characters. Perhaps a bit of The Sims.\n\nI don't know, it's not a perfect game. Driving is wonky, still a few glitches on Steam Deck, I'm loving it on Steam Deck almost like a new game, ever since the FSR 2.1 update. On Stadia it was awesome too but that's shutting down. There were some bugs on Stadia but it was generally smooth. Some floating phones and Sliverhand cigarettes \ud83d\udeac at first, but patches fixed a lot of that! I will pre-order Phantom Liberty for sure.\n\nYeah and of course Edgerunners was awesome. Surprised I wasn't alone in loving that! I'm at 62 hours as of writing this with 138 hours on stadia, clocking in at 200 play hours total and I still love this game. Haven't got all the achievements or full completion but pretty far with my first female Nomad character (Nomad is my favorite). Then have a female Streetkid. And a male Corpo, not that lifepaths matter but I find Nomad has a slightly longer and more interesting beginning... So, yeah, lol. From where I'm coming from, a great game. \n\nWith a future.",

        "content": "Could say a lot about this game but i'll be very brief :\n\n- Night City is alive. Don't dive in free roam mindset. Follow the stories and quests. This is not a GTA. CDPR strength lies in their storytelling through goal oriented gameplay. \n- Beautiful + superb atmosphere. Stop somewhere. Anywhere. Look around. Everything is unique, detailed. It oozes with quality, you can feel the pure love, effort and work which went into this game once you play it. Then again, free exploration feels pointless if you don't follow the quests and tasks.\n- Play with mods.\n\nObviously has flaws which you can read everywhere or experience first hand. They don't need long to be evident. You can sort of feel the development was maybe spread thin across getting story telling, rpg elements and gta like format. Most of the flaws seem to come from this wish to do everything to please everyone. \n\nBut one thing they nailed for sure : I miss Night City and want more of it.\nI recommend.",

We need things that can make the world feel alive and real. just enough to rely on only a little imagination to make us feel as if it's our story. Things like being able to eat. Having places to go like the movies or rock concerts and etc. Things that ground the game in our imaginations. Kinda like the things you showed us, or tried to make seem like we could do. In that 40 some minute video you showed us a year before release. It's a good game just very bare. very bare.",

        "content": "Good game. Clearly has a lot of effort poured into the characters and script writing. Performances are top tier. Atmosphere is some of the best world building out there. I love all the different ways you can take the story. Playing what I felt was the same way twice yielded surprisingly different results in story missions. High replay value. Being able to see all the areas (and some characters) from the Edgerunners anime is a treat.\n\nGameplay overall is repetitive, but fun. I would argue it's hard to have an open world game NOT be repetitive these days so It's not really a knock as far as I am concerned.\n\nStealth leaves something to be desired. I've played a lot of Deus Ex, and it has that vibe down. I went in thinking I could play the same way, like a stealthy hacker. This is not the case. While there are plenty of stealth gameplay elements and skills, it doesn't scratch the stealth itch for me.\n\nOutstanding run and gun gameplay, if you love borderlands in any capacity you are going to have a blast shooting people.\n\nDriving controls are pretty awful, but you get used to it. Do yourself a favor and use the 3rd person view (Q).\n\nThe upgrade and crafting system is robust. I found it very confusing at first. I played about 30 percent of the game first playthrough without any cyberware. There is a LOT of junk to carry, I don't even look at what I'm looting 90% of the time since I'm just going to scrap it for parts or eddies.\n\nMin-Maxing armor as it comes to you will have you looking like a hobo, thank god they have a wardrobe feature that acts as a skin to this. MASSIVE options for character customization.\n\nElephant in the room: Is this game glitchy? Yes. Is it any better than GTA or Skyrim in that regard? No. \nIt's gotten better with patches thats for sure.\n\nIt can play on a moderate to entry level gaming PC without issue. That being said, the sky is the limit for visuals in this game, even a 4090 can't take advantage of your high end refresh rate monitor at max settings. It is easy to find the settings to play at an acceptable framerate (30-60) and still enjoy the way it looks. So in that regard, if you love to tinker and benchmark, this game is a must.\n\nNow delta the fuck out of this review and go get yourself some preem chrome choom!",

        "content": "It's an overall enjoyable experience. I picked it up 50% off though, and would recommend everyone else do the same as I cannot recommend you spend the full \u00a340+ on it. The quests and writing are mostly strong with a few standouts (I especially enjoyed Joshua Stephenson and Johnny's) which tackle complex and interesting subjects, the graphics are gorgeous even on relatively modest rigs, and the music goes hard. Other users have pointed out shortcomings though. \n\nIt's undeniably still a buggy mess, not well optimised, and a lot of the main side characters feel shallow. Judy and Panam's quests and personalities feel much more developed than Rivers' for example. It also suffers from \"open world syndrome\" where you're running around following objectives in a city that has a terrible uncanny valley feeling, where it's not quite alive and immersive enough that it becomes off putting. A less major gripe is that a lot of systems, like crafting, feel fiddly and superficial. What's the point really when the best gear is the iconic stuff anyway? And why bother with any sort of puzzle if the game's just going to hold your hand the whole time?\n\nOverall though, the gameplay experience is polished, clean, and mostly makes up for its major shortcomings. The gunplay is tight, character progression feels meaningful, and there'a a good diversity of play styles catered for. I played a stealthy netrunner ninja type, but I certainly didn't feel like I was missing out by not taking a different route. I wouldn't come into the game expecting a revolutionary RPG experience, but it has strong enough fundamentals to make it worth your while.",

Loved the story and connections u made with the characters, figured Keanu's part to play would be minor but was impressed with his story and character. went into this thinking it would be a 6/10 but in the end 9/10 is my final go at it simply for the fact that character creation was stellar and story kept me interested until the very end. Now that im finished however im finding hard to pick up again even with multiple endings I kinda predicted what they would be like and dont have the drive to see them or play any aftergame content. Im very excited where  Red decides to take this and hope alot of tha story bridges to the next possibly allow import content and carry the character over. <3",

The gameplay is very addictive. Playing with katana or cybernatic mantis arms is so cool. Only real problem I got is the driving in the game. Vehicles don't handle very well and you can't shoot from your car. Guess I am a bit too used to GTA driving system. \nFound some minor bugs, tho. But nothing really game breaking so far. \nI hope this game will get great DLC and maybe some patches for the bugs. \n\nGive this game a try when it is on sale (like I did, hehe)",

Only fix is to reload an earlier save. Clearing out NCPD scanner tasks? NCPD can set a wanted level on you when you shoot your targets. TWO YEARS LATER and they still haven't fixed these bugs plus tons more which have been reported since release.\n\nTwo years later game is still mediocre, lack of companions makes the already dead open world feel even more dead, removed gameplay elements from the launch trailers still not added back in the game, terrible AI and constant gameplay bugs make this more of a chore to play than an enjoyable experience.",

Even through all the bugs, strange design choices, lag, terrible optimization, etc.\nCDPR created one of the most interesting and engaging stories ever, and built an incredible and diverse world to house it. I've never been quite as captivated with an 'RPG' story driven type game as I was with this one. \nI was lost in Night City the moment I loaded up for the first time. \nNowadays, most of the hiccups have been ironed out by either CDPR's updates, or the modding community. It runs smoothly, looks beautiful, and is a blast to play. It's sort of quirky, the gunplay is strange compared to most modern shooters, but even with the quirks and rough patches, I can't put it down. Really looking forward to seeing what the future holds for the world of CP2077.",

Helping the NCPD with little events accur in the city before jumping off to the big missions.\nupgrading items and collecting loot, hacking all sorts of terminals and caches to earn eddies, buying vehicles, customizing your character with lot's of options and creating outfits. Crafting items, changing weapons sights, interactions with random people, side missions that you get from people you met on the main missions. \nAlso, having the camera edit is amazing, you can literally pose your character in many different places and make sick photos, so many poses, options, creativity can be off the roof with this feature.\n\nAnd one important thing which makes this game kickin' arse, the combat. The combat in this gaming is fantastic, the satisfaction when you shoot, the sound of the guns, the impact when you hit, the slow motion\nthe entire mechanics on it are amazing. I could say that the hand to hand combat is not that great but its still okay.\n\n\n\nthe downsides are not that big at all :\nyou can sometimes find yourself watching people glitching inside eachother, glitching character animations, sometimes interactions don't work. event triggers sometimes do not work and you can't continue. \ncrashes sometimes, low fps drops (barely noticeable)",

        "content": "Even with all the bug fixes and patches, the game still has flaws like most new \"open world\" games. Some side missions are copy/paste. The main part of the game including Johnny are what more people are going to enjoy in my opinion as they have more depth, with multiple dialogue options in most conversations. If you play the game now as it is there are still bugs and glitches, but ProjectRed has been striving to make the game great and it shows, the modding community is great if you're into it and its nice to see the Devs support it. Overall the game does have its flaws but i would still buy it again to replay the main missions. 3/5",

        "content": "The game has flaws, but when it works it works well.\n\nPros:\n-Nice Colorful graphics\n-Good conversion of the TTRPG setting\n-Fun if a bit repetitive combat\n-Nice skilltree, and cyber enhancments\n-Cool looking vehicles\n-Some cool story moments\n-Mods\n-Everything fully voiced\n-(Quick) Hacking works well and is useful \n- Cool\n-Keanu Reeves\n\n\n\nContra:\n-Really shitty vehicle controls, especially cars (bikes work better since you can dodge more cars and crap)\n- Game is stable at the moment, but uh boy was it unstable before (I hear in the beginning it was a mess, and the recent 1.6 update. 1.61 is stable again) crashes for me when I go down from high to medium settings, but not alot. Still worried it will be a bugfest again if they decide to update again.\n-Alot of boring repetive \"busywork\" missions only good for grinding/listining to podcasts mostly\n-Levelcap\n-Would wish for more/crazier cybermods (mostly visually) like some can be seen in game but you have no access to them. Still overall decent amount of cyber-enhancements, just would wish for more, like you can make an Adam Smasher build, and loosing humanity/cyber psychosis could be an issue.\n-Feel the games story is too \"railroady\" at times, would wish for more freedom and more of a roleplaying/Sandbox experience.\n-Some story moments feel forced and cringey, but I guess they weren't meant for me.\n-Also feel the game had some annoying \"SJW\" bullshit character moments but not as many as to ruin the overall experience.\n-Also too much dialogue at times inbetween action. Ive played Roleplaying games with less dialogue, but I guess the whole \"Video games want to be movies\" obscession is stronger then ever with devs.\n-The female straight love interest Panam was okay, but she is too much of a \"Stronk Waman\" Mary Sue typical for todays age. Sadly it is the age we live in.\n-I found the Sinnerman Quest way to edgy and distasteful. They would never do this with any other religion. It is the cheap and expected safe exploitation in todays age.\n-Keanu Reeves (Whoah!)\n\n\n\n\nOverall I would still recommend this game if you enjoyed Fallout 4, and are okay with the negatives I have posted.",

Or you can kill everyone with hacks without even entering the building. Its up to you.\n\nThe place where this game really shines is its storyline and all of the side story archs that are in the game. And there are a lot of them.\n\nI recommend not touching the main story until you have finished all the side jobs. As some of them have story lines that are better/rival that of the main story arch (Dream On, or The Hunt for example).\n\nBy the time I went through the game, and finished everything, it felt like I had just watched the series finale of my favourite show. I just felt sad and depressed that there was no more.\n\nLuckily, there's an expansion coming next year.",

To compare it with other memorable gaming experiences, with this game I feel the same enjoyment as the first time I was going through Fallout 3.

        "content": "It took about 14 hours before the game really clicked with me. The initial story segments are nice, but then my first real meeting with the open world was painful. The game is not very good about communicating where you should and shouldn't go. Most of the quests are considered \"low/average/high/very high danger\" instead of recommended level. You might follow \"average danger\" quest and end-up in open world area full of enemies with skulls above their heads, which will kill you in one shot. Once I figured out where I could actually go to it was much more manageable.\n\nThis game allows you to build your character mostly as you want, and whatever path you choose you'll probably end up overpowered. Want to go with bladed weapons? At one point you suddenly become a ninja that bathes in blood of their enemies, healing while killing, becoming invisible, and 90% of time spending in slow motion. Want to hack? Suddenly you sit at your desk and put the whole army to death with hacks. Want to stealth? Before you know if you clean up whole mall of enemies without being seen under 30 seconds. Batman can hide. What about explosives? Well, hope you find the bodies to loot afterwards. Crafting? You become a god of infinite money-making, with all the best hardware in the world. Oh, and there are guns too. I didn't try them out, but I'll bet you can do crazy things once you spec into them.\n\nYou can reset some of your build, but the main attributes of your character are set in stone. So if you'll go all-in into Intelligence and Cool(stealth) there's no re-speccing into a gunner or melee. But there's no problem switching from one Reflex weapon to another. Almost all weapons are in Reflex section, by the way. I feel like some Attributes do much more than others, but also, there's probably no way to make unplayable character.\n\nThe story... was a mixed bag for me. Good chunk of it is about your relation with another character, Johnny. But most of the time you build that relation you're in the open world doing stuff in your own order. The result, for me, was incoherent. At one time me and Johnny were best friends, because the quest assumed we would be, and next scene we're trying to kill each other. Most jarring was the very beginning, Johnny just tried to kill me for the first time, and within 60 seconds of it we were talking like old pals.\n\nI generally liked the main campaign, although I feel the endings were not gradual enough. You basically choose one of 3 packages, and you take everything that comes with that package. (This is not a true ending, but an example). If you decide to side with the police you get them to help you in the final confrontation, but also need to join the police afterwards, and live happily in the 13 precinct till the end of your days. You cannot ask the police to help, but decide to live the rest of your days as a nomad. I also found no ending fitting for the V I was roleplaying. I was roleplaying a punk, as you know, this is cyberpunk, who disliked Johnny. There is no option for such person. I took second best thing, and it really didn't feel like my V.\n\nThat said, the V is pretty cool. S(he) is less defined than commander Shepard, but mostly an existing character. There is, for example, a moment where you can talk about your past love life, and V has some stories to tell. It's not a representation of you, it's a V, which you can influence a bit. That said, there are not that many places you can influence. Sometimes I had to get into a trap on purpose just to trigger a sidequest, or do things I don't think V would do, just to get to a quest.\n\nThe sidestories in this game are pretty good, but they are all isolated affairs. For example you might win a boxing tournament, and it will have your friend Viktor in it. But if you ever meet Viktor he will not comment on you being a boxing champion. There were quite a few places where my actions from other quests should/could influence what was happening, but there was no option to leverage it. \n\nThe game also has very little mechanics that make the gamer feel like the game acknowledges the player. You gather reputation, and at some point you might even max it out. But start working with a fixer, and he will treat you as a newbie who only just came to a city, and no one heard about you. In other games NPCs on the streets might comment on you, or you might hear in the radio about your exploits. Not here. For the most part. There are chat messages you can get from NPCs after quests, where they'll present some kind of epilogue to their story. Or send you some photos. On very rare occasions your love interests might talk about different quests you went trough, but for me it only happened once. Usually they were just static part of the background once their quest-line was over. \n\nThe one thing everyone complains about is the police AI. I didn't play this like GTA, but man, the police is irritating. Policemen act like a gang, if you move near them they'll attack you for no reason. I had a situation where I was interacting with a coffee machine and police started shooting at me. Police aggression disables your fast travel, or access to quick sell points. I really suggest installing a mod that disables random police attacks, and just makes them fight you once you start committing crimes. \n\nYou can implant a lot of cyberware into yourself. You cannot uninstall once installed cyberware, but you can exchange it for another. While it provides fun customisation I didn't really like the system. Most of the implants don't change how V looks. One would want to be able to chrome out as much as other characters you meet, but the most you can get are some stickers on your hands. Furthermore, most of the cyberware is only available in one store. There's about a dozen of them in the world, so if you want to find the best version of hands implants you have to check all stores until you find one selling a legendary option. But some cyberware end up on lower rarities, and you have no way to know which one is the best. It's totally unnecessary, since the purchases are tied to your reputation system anyway. All cyberware stores should have access to all items you have access to... wouldn't be to unrealistic, but much more enjoyable. There's similar issue with high-level crafting, when you might spend hours looking for schematics that you need, because you don't know which store sells it. Or just check the wiki. But it all was very unnecessary and needlessly convoluted. \n\nIn general your choices are just roleplaying for the sake of roleplaying. To make your V yours. But there are few moments, that I call jRPG traps. You know, like in jRPGs you will permanently miss out on ultimate weapon if you didn't look under your bed during the opening scene of the game? And you will find about it only after 100 hours of gameplay, in a game with no decisions and consequences? Well, that is exactly how cyberpunk does stuff. You decide to hit a guy that, by the game description, is the worst human in the world? Sorry, best cyberware is now out of your reach. Who cares that in this game you constantly kill people for less than that guy did, this one time there are consequences. And there are 3-4 places like this, where out of nowhere you'll be punished for roleplaying.\n\nThe game has some bugs. I got blocked out of completing one quest. But most of the bugs are simple glitches, things floating here and there and funny open-world shenanigans. Honestly, Skyrim after 10 years is still much more buggy.\n\nDon't trust the haters, play this. It's fun, but imperfect. It has high quality, and runs well considering how it actually looks. It's not a dream game, and probably doesn't live up to the hype some people had, but if you look at what is there you'll find just really good game, one of the better ones you can play in 2022.",

I like the addition of body modifications like mantis blades, gorilla arms etc. The only issue i have is the driving. It doesn't feel very responsive and has delayed input which makes the vehicle/bike very slippery when applying brakes and has poor handling. Apart from that the side content and various gigs provide extra insights on the characters otherwise the main story is not that long. Do the side quests as you play along the main story because the side contents have a lot of branching which can get very interesting.",

This is making me angry. Whatever the reason is, people are hating this game, it has nothing to do with actual quality and objective measurement against competitions games. Is it buggy ? Very buggy, is it worse than any Bioware game released lately ? Not by a mile. Is it buggy as one of the best games ever - Fallout New Vegas ? Not even that, i crashed 1x when i tried to play in 4k on my ancient potato pc, and one time it froze so i had to close the game. In 100 hours of this massive-story telling-rpg is absolutely ridiculously fine.  This is one of the most expensive games in history and the production value breathes at you at every turn, in every way. \n\nThis reminds me, one of my favorite movies The Thing, was absolutely hated at first when it came out in 1982. Now its considered one of the best horror movies ever made. Give Cyberpunk 2077 a 15 years and people will laugh at you if you tell them this was considered bad game.",

In late game, just wading into crowds of enemies with a shotgun rarely resulted in deaths.  The game is visually nice, but it just feels...empty?  The gameplay is definitely repetitive.  Small crowd of bad guys doing...whatever.  Wade in...kill them all.  Rinse and repeat.  I felt very little connection to the protagonist or any of the side characters.  It just feels like there was more planned for story and gameplay development that just didn't happen.  Character level should be pushed to 60 isntead of 50.  I hit 50 with truckloads of side missions and NCPD stuff left to do.   Overall...nice looking but...meh.",

The other 20% is for the programmers and software folk on this game who got crunched into doing damage control for the botched release that they had next to no control over. The game is great, I really like it, but goddamnit people would have waited another year for release if the game would have had a semblance of completion to it. Can't rush games, can't rush programmers. Studio MDHR knows this and it's why all of their products are certified bangers.",

F that id rather die\n\nokay so i throw away the contract and go home right? nah end credit scenes show everyone saying goodbye to me and wishing me well for the rest of my life that ill live out in space. bruh my gf didnt even know what happened and skipped town. load of bull but oh well. good game up to that point at least. \n\nfeels like cdpr got rushed cos i only thought i was hitting the halfway point when i was told i was doing the end mission and that probably is what happened so cant blame them. give the game a shot the side stories are worth it at least.",

Cyberpunk 2077's launch was no where near as bad as battlefield 2042's though. Anyway this game is a wonderful experience, somehow they managed to make the character have a fuck ton of weight to them and each action you make in their personal story lines feels like it does make an impact of sort. The combat has issues from time to time, but it is still fun. One thing I dislike about it is that enemies don't spawn around the map in the endgame like they do in early game so urges of mayhem are harder to satisfy. Soundtrack to the game is 10/10.",

        "content": "I was a Cyberpunk fan as soon as the first trailer came out for it in 2013. I knew nothing about the game but even from that short trailer I knew that the company behind it was passionate. 'When it's ready' was such a powerful message. Even though it wasn't gameplay footage, the quality of the video was nothing like I had ever seen before. Fast forward to 2020 and the launch was horrid. The message was no longer, 'When it's ready' the message was now 'When our stockholders say so'. It was so sad, I had been hyping myself up for almost a decade. I had talked it up to my friends saying that it was going to change videogames forever. It was so bad that I didn't want to pay to play it, I had seen so many videos of just how short the game fell. I was saddened. Since then, CDPR has been working diligently to gain back the attention of its initial audience by fixing bugs, releasing free content, and polishing the game overall. About a month ago I bought the game since it was $30 on steam, I thought the worst that could happen is that I play it just for the story. Almost 130 hours later and I'm loving every second of it. It's still my first playthrough and it gets repetitive at times, and the world doesn't feel as alive as I'd like it, but it manages to capture my attention and keep it. Currently, its about at 60% of what was promised but I'll take it. With the wide popularity of Edgerunners its brought in a whole new audience and returning players. With a sequel in the works and it being on Unreal Engine 5 (by the time it releases it might be ported over to Unreal Engine 6/7) I'm very excited for what's to come. Now is the best time to play this game and the next best is tomorrow. Enjoy Night City, chooms!",

Realistic city my ass.\n\nStory was somehow both under and overwritten. Overwritten with lore, underwritten with character. Cool, I got to bang my girlfriend in a mind meld tank. I felt literally nothing, just empty. It was just a lame knockoff of Blade Runner 2049's sex scene. All the voice acting sounded like everyone wanted to go home.\n\nWhat a hot mess\n\n4/10",

Cyberpunk 2077's open world and story line was great with interesting characters, yet it also felt linear. Your \"actions\" did not seem to have that much of an impact at all.\nSummarize: Decent game that did not entirely add up to the preconceived hype 6.5-7/10.

I would compare it to patched Bethesda titles. I keep restarting the game - got about halfway through the story, maybe lol - and having an amazing time exploring Night City. It still has glitches, mostly harmless, and you're on your own if like me you decide to go modding - the game is fairly stable vanilla, but mods to tend to make the game \"ride the edge\" just a little bit more. I definitely recommend this game on sale to anyone, and would recommend it even full-priced to anyone interested in 3d fps rpgs.",

        "content": "Yeah the game is buggy and looks like shit. I'm not gonna deny it, but I didn't come for perfect graphics and a seamless game. I came for the story. I've seen videos and game play, and I've seen the anime. Something is unrivaled in the story for Cyberpunk 2077. I really don't know what it is but something about it feels so seamless, it's immersive, it's intriguing, mysterious. It's fun. The story is one of the best single player story lines I have ever played, and while it may not keep me coming back again and again for other playthroughs and alternate stories, I sure as hell got my time out of this game and I enjoyed literally every minute of it. Play all the side quests and gigs, you won't regret it.",

The story and characters are very well represented, it shows you the true morality of all of the people who live in Night City, and it is an experience I have only found in a few other titles. Sure there were bugs, and still are, but I rarely encounter any at all other than NPCs collision with vehicles occasionally. I am on my second playthrough and I am still discovering whole sidequests and gigs I didn't know about even after scouring the entirety of the city on my first run through. Definitely worth the pick up if you like a rich world with many expansive stories and locations to explore. Can't wait for the DLC!!!",

        "content": "[b]TL;DR[/b]: Probably worth a buy the next time it's on sale, but still a flawed game.\n\nThe Good:\n[b]The World:[/b] Night City is a fantastic setting and the world is big enough that you don't feel like there are walls boxing you in. The world is consistent and fun to explore and easy to get lost in.\n[b]The Sub-Plots:[/b] Time and time again, I found myself getting lost in one side-quest or another. The characters that these lines explore are well thought out and feel human and it felt like a genuine opportunity to shape who your character was.\n\nThe Bad:\n[b]The Main Plot:[/b] Gosh, this was the least interesting quest line in the entire game (Okay, I'm being a bit hyperbolic, but it was rough). It works for a little bit, but eventually you realize that the urgency that the game places upon the completion of the quests is entirely fake and then the invisible thread tugging you along the plot is snapped. It almost has to be for the rich, exploratory gameplay that the game encourages in every other aspect to work. There's no real choice in how the story evolves until the very end and, based on what you pick, the game ends in a slightly different flavor of melancholy. This would be fine, but this is a game that asks you if you'd rather live a quiet life or go out in a blaze of glory, and none of the endings deliver on either of those, instead you end up (probably) going out in a disappointing puff of smoke.\n[b]Difficulty Balancing:[/b] My hubris led me to playing this game on hard in my first playthrough. That was a mistake. increasing the difficulty doesn't make the AI better, it just makes their guns stronger and armor thicker. You'll die in (literally) two or three shots while, picking up the same weapon that just killed you 27 times and using it on an enemy will take 10 shots to kill. While, perhaps, it is realistic how easily you go down, the result of this is that most of the weapons in the game are worthless. Don't even bother with pistols, assault rifles, and (usually) melee weapons (though some enemies are impossible to hit with firearms... so keep one of these around and hope they don't kill you as you mad rush them with it). The only effective combat strategy in my experience is to maintain stealth as long as possible and use a sniper rifle that can one-shot headshot to extend how long you can maintain stealth.\n[b]Player Characterization:[/b] You have no real choices in what kind of person V is. This tends to be fine in stories like 'Life Is Strange' where you're not expected to imprint on Max super strongly (though I would argue that even that game does a better job than here), but this game prides itself on the sheer length of customization it gives you to V's appearance. But despite all of these options, the type of person V will be is the same from playthrough to playthrough. There's no good way to play a V with a different attitude or outlook and what choices there are are shallow and superficial. Frankly, save for a few pivotal (and incredibly obvious moments), your choices don't matter very much and when they do, it seems to be in mostly insignificant ways. \n[b]Linearity:[/b] For an open world game, Cyberpunk is rather linear. The sheer real estate taken up by the main plotline compared to the side quests is massive and it drive a lot of the game. The way the main quest line progresses, there tends a lot less waiting compared to many of the side quests where you have to wait a day for a character to go do something. This is realistic and even a little immersive, but at the end, where you're running out of side quests to do, it's really just a strong push to get back to the main quest.\n\nThe Ugly:\n[b]Glitches:[/b] I finally bought this game because I had heard that it had been patched and most of the glitches were gone and, based on what we saw at launch, they are! But people floating in midair or stuck in the T-pose are disappointingly common. I encountered two or three glitches that stopped me from completing a quest altogether, and quests glitching to uncomplete an objective you finished are somewhat common. You can look past the glitches and see a great game, but boy glitches are still here and common.\n[b]Driving:[/b] Gosh I hate driving in this game. It feels so slippery and hard to control. It's not that big a deal, you can use fast travel if you really hate it, but boy, the minute there were pedestrians or traffic, you end up with a lot of unintended fatalities.\n\n[b]OVERALL:[/b] It may sound as if I'm overly critical, but I really did enjoy this game. It's almost certainly not worth retail though. Pick it up on sale and hope that they fix a lot of the ugly bits.",

        "content": "TL;DR It's good for one 40 hour playthrough and only if you don't look up anything about how your dialogue \"impacts\" the story, and don't waste time on all the gigs and shopping. Unless the dlc turns it around, I would never buy this until the full price tag drops below $20\n\nI played the entire game. Did all the side quests and gigs, and most of the NCPD requests, before the final quest and I was so impressed... For all of like 30 minutes. Don't get me wrong, with all the updates and everything the game is good and stable. The ending is sort of somber and melancholy, much like other cyberpunk media. But the ending is also incredibly lackluster compared to the crazy hype of the opening sequences, lacks any real variety (hence why I call it an ending, instead of the \"multiple endings\"), and i spent more time going to and from quests than i spent on all the actual quests combined (and driving back and forth between the same 6 vendors).\n\nSpoilers From Here On:\n\nThe intro sequences are phenomenal. They are varied and bombastic. Each starting scenario will bring you to the same place eventually, with you and your buddy Jackie taking on a crazy heist job, where you inevitably get injected with rockstar-turned-super-terrorist-turned-digital-construct-turned-cyber-tumor Keanu Reaves. While they all bring you to the same point, to be brief, that point is about the craziest and most interesting premise for a game I've ever heard of, along with the promise of spending lots of time with Cyber-Tumor Keanu.\n\nThe game is filled with (seemingly) loads of choices. It feels like you could slip and go on a wildly (or even slightly) different path just by picking a different dialogue. You can't. Your choices don't matter. Your side quests will always start the same, end the same, and take the same paths every single time. The only different ending you can get in side quests is the \"i don't want to help you\" ending, where the questline immediately and rather abruptly ends. All other quests, called gigs, are \"talk at you for 30 seconds, go to yellow dot, kill 6-ish people and maybe steal something.\"\n\nThe main quest is the exact same, with the only difference being the final quest, which has \"2\" endings.\nSERIOUSLY HUGE SPOILERS\nYour options for how you take on the quest boil down to which characters you want to talk to while you do the same quest and what characters you talk to when it's all over. After which, you either \"die\" by being digitized and imprisoned/assimilated, or you have ~6 months to live. Those are your choices, all in a single dialogue choice, and nothing in the whole game affects them, not even a single line of dialogue to Cyber-Tumor Keanu. For one, let's be honest, you \"dying\" is not the real ending, and the ~6 months to live ending is also kind of a cop-out because in the moment you are making that decision, you are told it is absolutely certain, but then after the quest is over you're basically told, \"no, there's got to be something we can do,\" and then the credits roll. After which you are deposited to just before the final quest starts with some added loot and nothing to do.\n\nNearly everything else about this game is good. The gameplay, the weapons and skills, Cyber-Tumor Keanu, build customization. The driving is fine, but all the money you spend on cars is wasted since the game gives you the fastest one for free anyway, and none of the quests are dependent on your car. The city is breath-taking at first, but eventually you just ignore it and stare at the Adventure Line!(tm) on you minimap. And while some of the side characters are really interesting, once their quest is over they just don't do anything, save for the 3 that you can choose to buddy with for the final mission.\n\nI think the biggest problem is how little your dialogue with Cyber-Tumor Keanu impacts the ending. His interactions and dialogue are great. He could've been the thing that really turned the whole game around, but his endings are basically the same as yours. He either keeps your dying body and probably survives, or stays digitized and assimilates/gets deleted. So much potential and then nothing with no impact. Maybe they were trying to tell a tragedy, but it's just kinda melancholy, especially given the dialogue. I've felt sadder about much happier endings (hate to bring up the Witcher 3, but it's hard not to.)\n\nAfter all is said and done, it's an ok game, reels you in so strong, and then just kinda meanders around and then ends without much happening. Not worth the price tag. Maybe when its full price drops below that of the Witcher 3, I'll recommend it, but not a moment sooner.",

        "content": "Bretty gud. \nThe story is great, intriguing and complex and you'll legit care about the characters - especially thanks to the great voice acting. It's not as philosophically deep as the Matrix but it does make u think and Keanu Reeves is there. The game is beautiful, but it misses the melancholy that's characteristic of the cyberpunk genre. Plenty of neon tho, but there should be more. One can never have too much neon. \nGameplay is cool but missing that oomph which could've been some sort of, let's say, technomagic. You can hack computers and even people, but maybe adding some shiny abilities to spice it up would be great, like grappling hooks, lasers, holographic illusions, lightning, the sort. That said, you can mount a rocket launcher on ur arm, which is cool. Also their crafting system is simple, doesn't require too much grind and doesn't make me want to commit sudoku like Skyrim's.\nThe game's reputation was tarnished by the bugs, and while there's still some you barely notice anything. But they can be annoying. \nHowever the game should be more vertical, you know? More action on the top of buildings, more access to higher places, people living in precarious high-up slums with little foot bridges connecting the various quasi-hanging neighbourhoods. Especially more flying options. Like bruh, a futuristic game that doesn't give you flying cars or drones? Missed opportunity imo.\nAll in all, solid 8/10 game, would buy it again.",

        "content": "Started playing this nearly 2 years after release, so didnt experience all the issues with bugs during release. This is a great game. Night city is massive and really well done. I enjoyed the main storyline,  but given the amount of side quests and gigs there are, I felt that it almost forced you to complete it too soon, such that you kinda feel that there is so much that you missed. Basically once you get to a certain point in the main storyline you cant go back and complete other parts of the game, until you have completed the storyline and then it lets you go back to the last save before the endgame, which feels a bit silly as all youve done is just wind back time. Nevertheless its still a great game.\n\nThe game is like a much larger and more impressive version of the Deus-ex games, which were great in their time, but always felt a bit small and constrained by the maps. That certainly isnt the case with Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nThere are some things that could have been done better in the game. Until you get a really decent car, most of the time a motorbike is much better for getting around as you can weave through traffic better. Even when you have some of the fastest cars in the game or are on a motorbike the acceleration differential between normal cars on the road isnt big enough. If they didnt give the AI cars such good acceleration you could feel like it was much easier to cut through the traffic.\n\nAlso In the roleplaying game you couldnt just load up with a much cyberwear as you wanted as you ran the risk of going cyberpsycho. In this game you can have as much cyberwear as you want and there are no downsides. They should have limited your cyberwear based on your Cool stat. So the more cyberwear you want the higher you cool has to be and finally the net running skills are really good in combat, but its not a choice of being good with guns or blades or being good with quick hacking, you can be good at everything. Yes you can do a bit more damage if you put points into pistols or auto rifles, but I didnt heavily specialise in them and still felt I could totally wreck with guns if I wanted to. But by the time I got very good with quick hacking and had good quick hacking cyberwear  alot of encounters didnt really need much in the way of guns. Maybe im being picky and the harder difficulty levels might make the gun skills seem more worthwhile, but certainly on Normal you are a one man army.",

Before that, let me tell you one thing \u2014 I started playing the game after it's release and few patches. Did I encountered major bugs or something unexpected? Kinda, yes. I got lucky in such regard, and only what I expierenced was only once mission car got stucked in the ground, or Saul kept saying his line about Santiago, but overall? I can't complain on such topic.\n\nWhen it comes to story is written nicely, gameplay wise? Superb. I was running kinda hybrid build, and I came to simple conclusion \u2014 any build would work out for entire of game. I was running mainly with reflex (riffles, pistols, blades), technician (crafting, engineering), and quite a lot in cold blood and rest in body, results? In suicide run (one path worth of taking) I managed just fine, without any issues, more important? \u2014 I had my fun. Sure, there are few things I didn't like that much, but it was just minor details not worth of mentioning, and for anyone who wants to trying it out? Try it. It's not perfect tittle I have to say it, but after some patches, and hype from anime (didn't watch it, lol) I can recommend it. So, see you till new dlc be released chooms.",

My awe of beautiful Night City turned into frustration after a few hours. This world is severely lacking, even while being nice to look at. Braindead AI NPC's walk through walls, cars, at times they even vanish and respawn if they are out of frame for more than a fraction of a second. No one else rides bikes on the roads except for you. Sure you'd see some gangs on the street by their bikes but never ride them. Breaks immersion IMO. Some missions are still, even at patch 1.61 buggy as hell. I encountered a bug where I lost all my weapons, reloaded an earlier save then encountered the same problem again. I had to drop all my weapons on the floor then go confirm the action to end the mission. The story is great, combat is fun and the characters are nicely written, but with the great lore it has it still feels very hollow and depthless. The music absolutely slaps its so good lol. Idk, maybe if I got some a** from Panam I would have enjoyed it a little more.",

But these hickups were never game breaking.\n\nThe story line is fun but very short. you can probably finish the main campaign in under a day. However there are a lot of well thought out side quests that will make your play-through last much longer, I recommend you spend most of your time exploring those instead of focusing on the main quest. \n\nThe world is fun and beautiful. Even though there is a lot to do in night city. I did expect more for a game that was in development for nine years. But if you leave out that piece of information you'll wouldn't feel like it was lacking. And I would say that it's a game you can revisit in a few years with different choices and it'll still feel interesting.\n\nI have some gripes with the ending. I ended up getting the evil ending on my first try of the end boss. Feels like I was judged for the wrong thing. but maybe i'm evil? idk, felt a bit random.",

It looks like most of the severe game-breaking bugs were resolved but there is some still existing. \n\nI regularly encountered what I would consider some type of memory leak or bad driver from Nvidia on my 3080 where it would eventually run out of VRAM and start to page the pc ram. Reinstalling different drivers from Nvidia did nothing to resolve the problems. \nThis bug of course caused severe fps loss and I can only think that the game engine and the driver were not unloading resources properly. Saving the game and opening and closing it would resolve it. This obviously occurred much more frequently inside the night city areas. In the badlands I hardly encountered the issue. Outside of this, a few weird encounters with npc's acting strange.\n\nSo first things first. Gameplay/Gunplay is fun and addictive. You can specialize in multiple weapons or just go brute force and melee.\nQuickhacking is very powerful and breach protocol are interesting but the breach protocol got kind of old after doing it hundreds of times.\n\nStory-wise it was interesting, I liked the different paths just like with Witcher.\n\nSide missions were for the most part just to kill time, make some coin, upgrade your levels and skills.\n\nIf you are on the fence about buying it, wait for it to go on sale and play through it, its worth it but not for full price.",

Love the many tiny details in even the small gigs and missions, and love the diversity of your build and what kind of playstyle you want. In terms of bugs there is definitely much less than the launch but it's still there, a few times my progress got messed up by bugs and I had to reload an old save. Overall, 8.5/10",

        "content": "Cons: \n\u2013 2 years after its release, this game is still very unrefined and buggy. And these are not bugs that can be lived with, but the kind that often makes quests impossible: disappearing and teleporting characters, cut-off dialogues, cars appearing right in front of the hood, after a certain mission I had no way to buy new cars at all anymore, etc., etc...\n\u2013 Wasted potential. The game seems flat, even more when comparing it with the promises that were before the release. Where e.g. are major body modifications? \n\u2013 The game is short, including even side quests. \n\u2013 Choices in total do not have much impact on the story. Only on the ending itself. \n\nPros: \n+ Nice graphics (but with raytracing enabled, I had occasional glitches with textures),\n+ locations and design i.a. of cars, \n+ music!\n+ You can go through the missions in different ways (quietly, demolishing, with a sword in hand? As you want). \n\nHmm and the story. The story is good. Just good. \n\nTo sum up: \nWhile at times the game gave me fun, the repeated bugs ruined it and prevented me from bigger immersion. It is simply cheating to sell people a flawed product. Especially since it's been a long time since release and could be fixed.",

The story is good, the sidequests are enjoyable and not required, there's plenty to do in the game, and I didn't know how much I wanted this game until I watched the show and played it. \n\nHere's to praying that Phantom liberty is a slam dunk and the sequel to 2077 isn't a similar dumpster fire.

In a nutshell I'd compare this to another highly anticipated game before release; it's a way better game than Fallout 4. It's a better looter shooter/action and exploration game while also managing to be a 'medium to weak' RPG. If you want the best RPGs known to man, look elsewhere. Otherwise, immerse yourself in this awesome game.",

Save loads take a minute or more to pop up sometimes (on an NVMe SSD) and after completing the game, I was stuck in a limbo state where I couldn't do anything, not even jump or shoot. Restarting and reloading that save does nothing, and the game created over two dozen unique saves during the last mission for some reason. Not sure if I'm softlocked or if I'll just have to revert a decent chunk of progress because I was too dumb to make a manual save right before trying the final mission. Does that also mean I'm screwed out of endgame rewards? Will I have to mod them in? Hope this gets fixed ASAP, especially before New Game+ comes into play because this sounds like an issue that could brick saves entirely.\n\nOverall a fun game, probably great for Skyrim modding fans that want a little something different to tinker with to be honest.",

        "content": "I, like many others, came around to buying this game after watching through Edgerunners. I can wholeheartedly say that I'm glad I did - and I'm glad I waited. While there are still optimization issues needing to be fixed (largely the difference between Medium and High settings for some graphics features, which are disproportionate to actual visual difference) the game's never crashed on me, I've run into no progression-blocking bugs, and the bugs that remain are largely humorous at most when I do - rarely - run into them.\n\nThe gameplay's mostly fine - melee or netrunner are your most enjoyable paths compared to just shooting things. Something to still be tuned up is the handling on vehicles 'cuz oh boy does it feel like you're driving on butter when turning. But there aren't any critical gameplay flaws otherwise and I hear the melee system is even getting a revamp in the near future.\n\nWhat you'll stay for is the voice acting, narrative direction, and the immensely potent art direction for the design of the city, the badlands, all of it, not to mention the superb sound design and tracks. There's never a bad time to hop on a vehicle and cruise from destination to destination rather than use fast travel points, because there's more radio stations than you can shake a stick at and all of them have excellent music. The main and supporting cast are varied, rich in design, and excellently cast and acted - that goes for Keanu as Johnny Silverhand as well, and particularly the voice acting for V whether you're male sex or female sex, to the point that I wound up feeling V as a distinct character rather than a blank slate for myself - and didn't feel it was an impediment to the RP part of this RPG.\n\nClocks at about 60+ hours, provided you're like me and do all the side content before wrapping with the final missions. It's definitely shorter than I'd have expected, but considering the game was rushed out by executives, the lack of an extra 10-20 hours can probably be blamed on needing to fix the game before adding to it. And the Phantom Liberty DLC is due to drop in 2023, meaning there'll be plenty more to come.\n\nAll in all? I'd give this a solid 8.5/10 now. It's well worth the price.",

But, for what they promised, an RPG like the Witcher 3 or Fallout, this is really, really bad. There is no long reaching choices, the only RPG like mechanic is the skill tree, and even that is sub-par. The only things that effect the outcome of the ending are a few side quests and your dialogue choices with Johnny Silverhand at the end.\nIf you go into this game expecting what they promised for the past 7 years or so, you will have a bad time. But, like me, if you waited 2 years and tempered your expectations, the game is good. The story is great and so are the characters. But this just isn't an RPG. Not at all. If you understand that, then pick it up on sale if you're interested.",

Quests are often accompanied by very fitting cyberpunky vibes.\n\n[b]Night City[/b]\nThe city is extremely well designed and intricate. From the soundscape to how the highrises tower above you and they way so many nooks and crannies are explorable. You can tell a lot of heart has gone into designing it.\n\n[b]Voice acting[/b]\nEvery major character has a great voice actor tied to it.\n\n[b]Main quest and side jobs[/b]\nThe main quest is [i]amazing[/i], and when the world feels the most alive and radiant. Side jobs generally hold a very high quality and makes the world feel more alive by fleshing it out with different concepts, characters and so on.\n\n[h1]The bad[/h1]\n\n[b]Night City[/b]\nThe city just feels dead for the most part. There are a few exceptions where you stumble on fun dialogue between two NPCS. Anyone hoping for a cyberpunk GTA will be disappointed. NPC AI is really bad.\n\n[b]Driving[/b]\nDriving is still buggy, but alright as long as you don't collide. You can go flying like there's no gravity, or just wedge under cars and launch them. Cars sometimes spawn of out nowhere, as well as pedestrians. Some vehicles just had their own life, at least for me, and just drifted out of control at certain speeds.",

        "content": "The game had an incredibly rough start, with major gamebreaking bugs and glitches, although I myself never really encountered anything too bad I have seen videos of them. I bought it the day it came out, and actually had a pretty good time, but I never really got into it that much. \n\nNow, 2 years later I can without a doubt say that it's one of my favorite games of all time. I encountered very very few bugs throughout my playthrough, and the ones I did weren't game breaking at all. The gameplay is good, but what really stands out is the exceptional story telling and character development, and amazing voice actors. I love story rich games with great character design, and Cyberpunk is no exception, I really can't help falling in love with all the different characters Night City has to offer, Especially Kerry, Judy, the Aldecaldos and of course Johnny. \n\nThe game is really beautiful, but might require a semi hardcore rig to get the best settings, at the moment I myself got an Intel i9-11900F and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 and 16GBs of RAM, and had all my settings on Very High, with around 80-100 fps.\n\nThat's about all I have to say, it'll probably be one of those games that I'll revisit every year or other year.\n\nTLDR: Great game with exceptional story telling and character design and fun gameplay. Couple years later and pretty much all of the gamebreaking bugs are gone.",

        "content": "TL;DR - They certainly put a lot of effort into this game and while it's technically worth $59.99 from that standpoint, the quality of what has been delivered isn't that of a triple A title. I'd suggest waiting until this is at least half priced, at which point you can go through and enjoy it for a great story with some amazing characters.\n\n\n2 years later... this game still feels quite unfinished. I waited the 2 full years to play it because I had read all the reviews about how bad the bugs were- I can't imagine having played back then given how messy it still is. I think at this point if you want the \"true Cyberpunk experience\" that everyone anticipated and the dev originally advertised, you will have to wait until the sequel comes out (UE5 engine thank god)... which at the time of writing this I don't believe is under development yet. So that's going to be at least another 5-8 years.\n\nI'll give credit where it's due-\n\n>The writing and story is top notch. The dialogue feels very real- it really simulates making friends with many of these characters. \n\n>Some of if not the best written characters I've played with in a modern game- core characters particularly. Their personalities, facial expressions and body language are really well done. We are stepping into a new age of detail here, in my opinion where I truly see how far we've come from the early 90's\n\n>Some of the characters (story related ones) have amazing detail and effort put into their visual design. Skin imperfections, freckles, pores, veins, scars- the list goes on. The attention to detail level is very high.\n\n>Voice acting is high quality. Main story characters effectively convey a full range of emotions.\n\n>The combat/skill trees feel like you have a lot of choices that offer dynamic gameplay.\n\nAs for the issues- there are a bunch that I will criticize, but I want to be clear that this game is a must have for any PC gamer. There is obviously much content cut from the game and plenty of bugs. The biggest issue of all is how the city kind of feels somewhat empty despite being full of NPCs. Once the graphic novelty and story begin to fade away, you're kind of playing GTA with more in depth combat.\n\n>The game has system crashes that are seemingly random. It's gotten worse the longer I've played and there's a plethora of the same complaints on reddit. It might be the current patch.\n\n>The city feels like an empty facade; hardly any of the storefronts are real and 99% of the NPCs you can have no interaction with. It's almost like playing GTA from 15 years ago with modern graphics. Everyone in the world is basically a zombie with the occasional bad guy mixed in.\n\n>Quest NPC and vehicle pathing will plow through terrain objects in hysterical fashion\n>Quest NPC and vehicles get stuck\n>Terrain objects you're not interacting with will randomly shoot across the screen at high speed- literally happens when they come in view.\n\n>Pathing lines for direction/quest trackers have broken Z axis and will occasionally send you up or down steps, placing you above/below here you need to be and or in directions that are less efficient. They also seem to update late; EG, you will be closer to the objective in a different path but on your map radar it will still direct you going a further way around.\n>Enter/exit wrong side of cars, including hijacking driverside can happen as hijacking passenger side.\n\n>Upon death, enemy bodies will get suspended on any and all objects and float in awkward positions; this is something you'd expect from a $10-15 game and not a $59.99 triple A title. Dead bodies will appear contorted and bent in unintentionally hilarious directions. Most enemies you kill will land in some ridiculous position. For a game that went above and beyond with detail in so many areas, this part is pretty messy.\n>Enemy body parts/limb severing is very low quality. Basically there's no blood and you'll just see an arm in the middle of a white floor with nothing around it- looks super janky.\n>Blood on skin shifts around as a whole like a separate texture layer. On close ups and during the story quest it looks pretty bad. Blood also bisects through body parts; there will be a 2d sheet of blood in the middle of a body part and it looks like the blood is floating.\n\n>Volumetric clouds can have a massive FPS drop (1-5 FPS) in some areas despite playing on an i9-12900k and 600w RTX 4090\n\n>Cut content is rampant. Storylines will have you in places that make it out to be something that will be used later to only find out that it's been removed because of \"insert story excuse here\" and they get to cut some content/save time to force the premature release back in 2020.\n>All adult content was basically cut out despite sexualized marketing for the game. There's no actual strip clubs, despite some cool looking ones out there with doors that will never open. Braindance doesn't exist for fun- it's purely used in detective work despite being talked up all game as a pleasure thing. As I searched there's two \"Joytoy\" (hookers) in the entire game. Genitals are in the charbuilder despite not being part of the game in any way, which begs the question why it even exists in the first place.\n\n>Vehicle physics and control is very exaggerated and not in a great state, unless you are in one of the endgame models at which point it's \"ok\".\n>Sprint will occasionally stop working and require game reload to correct",

        "content": "This game is fairly large, so 35 hours is like less than 1/3 of it, but it's off to a fun start. \n\nGraphics: they're fine. It doesn't matter though. That's not what you're here for. You're here for the aesthetic, the vibe, the feel, the flavor, and, on factory settings, the film grain and motion blur bring that and leave all those sharp edges at home. They got the feel right and that's what's important.\n\nImpact: For all the running and gunning, senseless slaughter, and satirical ads being hurled at your eyeballs with enormous force at breakneck speed, there's an emotional side to cut all that raw, saccharine violence. It's the salt on fine chocolate or bitters in a sweet cocktail trick and it works here as well as it does in food. If you come along for the ride, savoring the bittersweet moments, it'll hurt a bit, making all the sandbox staples of murder and mayhem feel fun again, even if you've played em' all before.\n\nConclusion: It's Deus Ex with less originality and more emotion. It has more heartfelt moments than most 3A games, but the mechanics, gameplay, and formula are ripped from Dying Light, GTA, and The Sandbox Handbook. \nIt's f***in' fun. Try it. \n\nP.S. Oh, and the bugs everyone heard about on release seem to be brought down to the level of any other sandbox game, so I guess they fixed most of em'.",

Sometimes mid game, i just stand there, just absorbing the view, windowshopping all the street vendors, the foodstalls just admiring the details, in some randos who just flatlined's home and thinking, damn this is not bad place you have here, i wonder how it feels to live here for a couple of days and just chillin. the vibe of the city, the luxury of the corpos, even the badlands somewhat aesthetic and make me wish i would want to experience all this vibe IRL. \nthere is some bugs in the beginning, but getting less atrocious every patch update.  \n\nOverall personally I can't think of anything on the market that would give me a better cyberpunk genre experience than Cyberpunk2077.",

I have found myself in places I haven't been before quite a lot even though I play regularly. Keanu Reeves being part of it all doesn't hurt either... ^^ \nI only experienced some minor bugs but nothing game braking, I actually like them, ads to the fun for me personally. For instance when a bunch of NPCs suddenly walk into your parking car and dramatically fall down like some football player that got slightly pushed, trying to get the other player a red card, hilarious. A police system instead of them just spawning behind you would make the game perfect, so I really hope that will be realized. It's not something that puts me off the game, I just think compared to everything else being so detailed, it's current state is extremely unfitting. \nStill, I love the game, it's like the gift that keeps on giving!",

        "content": "After finally finishing Cyberpunk 2077 on my 4th return to the game to give it another chance, I can say I'm glad I did. After putting aside the initial frustration I felt at the game for its \"undercooked\" release and coming to the game in a mindset of actually completing it. While watching the story rather than just rolling my eyes and slamming the \"skip\" button I decided \"why not just see how Keanu does in this?\" and I was not disappointed by the twists and turns the story takes you on. Coming from someone who originally used to call this game \"cyberpiss\" back in the day, I completely retract that statement and can happily say this game sits in my top 10 favorites for sure. The modding community and the fact that CD PR has given open access to the modding tools for the game only opens up more opportunities for variety of gameplay as well. Full price or on sale, I highly recommend this beast of a game.",

That was just the \"bad\" part of the game, everything else feels great, gameplay, story, and I get to take revenge for Rabecca against Adam Smasher, so that's even better.",

I think The story is great and had me engaged throughout my time playing. I also found the side quests to be entertaining but a bit hit or miss, some are great and have a great story to themselves others can be quite boring or very strait forward with no meaningful hook (these can still be fun but not nearly as much as the more in depth missions).  I'm a fan of the TTRPG and think the devs missed some opportunities from the history of the world that could have been further incorperated into the game and there are generally a few places where I saw missing potential. beyond story the gameplay is fun, graphics are great.\n\n Overall a very fun game with a engaging central story, not a masterpiece but no one should have ever expected to be one honestly.",

(probably because the devs knew that the majority of the players will be males). There's so much that SHOULD have happened that didn't. Also, if you do stay in night city with him, V is dying anyway and they seem unhappy and distant even though they're together. Where's our happy ending? :(\n\n#justiceforstraightfemaleV",

There are times this game feels too real for comfort. Times I've taken on certain side quests as a reprieve from the emotional impact of the previous one. Trigger warnings have to be given for mental abuse, physical and sexual abuse. Sometimes playing this game is genuinely harrowing, other times it's a wonderful joy. But it's always fun, and its always impressive in it's storytelling, and the depth of its characters. Some things could be streamlined, but this game is one of those rare near-perfect gems. Mature, unique, deep, engaging, and plain old fun.",

        "content": "The Game is Definitely worth buying now. It was in such a sorry shape when if it first came out. \n\nI love using the Mono wire to cut bad guys up. The gameplay is where this game shines. So many different builds to test out and have fun with\n\nThe story itself needs a lot of retcons. Jacky should have been a longer arch. The conversation options are so off sometimes its like why did they bother putting in choices at all. But hopefully theyre going to learn from this and make a better game with the unreal engine 5",

        "content": "Quick review for anyone interested in this game. Most of the bugs from launch are ironed out, any that you rin into will not in any way be game breaking, but will definitely ruin immersion for a short while. These bugs include loss of audio in cutscenes, t-posing in and out of cutscenes, and strange glitches such as npcs teleporting around/cars exploding for no reason. Night City has a lot to offer, and the game offers a variety of unique and diverse build paths for anyone looking to make multiple runs through the game. Where the game is fleshed out, it feels incredibly immersive, although unfortunately a large chunk of the map is quite empty and void of content. Overall I give the game a solid 5/10 after my 40-50 hour playthrough, I bought this game on sale for 30 dollars and consider it 30 dollars well spent, but absolutely would not recommend anyone pay full price for the game.",

I get a few frame stutters and freezes that come out of it each time, on occasion, but that might just be my drivers for my graphics card. Also, I get a non-game breaking bug once in awhile where the entire game loses all color and becomes black and white, textures also disappear when it happens. Almost like the game was sent to the shadow realm. I swear the first time I saw it, I thought it was an artistic choice until I realized, no...that's a bug. Its an easy fix, just save the game, reload the save, and it corrects itself. Other than that, I didn't pick this up day one, waited almost a year and a half after release to buy it, payed $30 US, definitely worth the $30.",

The voice acting is incredible, the story lines are good, the gun play and melee are solid. What you can do with character builds and upgrading is incredible. If you have mot played CyberPunk 2077 and you are still on the fence, Buy it, play it, love it. \n If you got problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems and not playing CyberPunk 2077 ain't one.",

I even watched Edgerunners (highly recommendable) before playing the game. \n\nNow, with my first playthrough completed, I am in love again. The game is an absolute banger, upgraded by Edgerunners, but probably even without it a 9,5/10. \n\nI highly recommend the game to anyone who is into a 25-30h solo ride in an amazingly looking world. Even some of the side-quests are great and CP was one of the few games that made me sit through the entirety of the credits. \n\n",

One of the few games I've played that made me want to end up doing all the side content. The only negative to this was that by end game I had far outscaled the main story and the end content was trivially easy. Mantis blades for life!\nI'll almost certainly end up revisiting the game and playing it through from a different perspective, with different tactics and skills.\nIncredible graphics.\n\nCons:\n-- Bugs --\nThere are some occasional bugs, some silly and a couple rather game breaking that can require some save/loading. \nAt one point during the mall mission for the Voodoo boys all the doors were blocked and I had to reload and trigger things in a different way to get through.\nAt another, all the lighting completely disappeared and I had to restart the game for everything to look right again.\nYou'll see pedestrians flying in the middle of traffic from time to time. That kind of thing.\nIt's recommended to keep multiple saves, although the game does seem to keep some from key points from the past several hours of playtime or so.\n-- Controller --\nThe \"skip dialog\" button is fantastic but they mapped it to the same as the crouch button and there didn't seem to be a way to remap the controller in-game. This can be quite frustrating for certain sections when dialog just pops up and you accidentally skip it trying to re-enter stealth\n-- Combat --\nThe mantis blade executes knock you out of time slow mode. This is pretty dumb and you learn ways to prevent the execute animation from happening just to avoid this",

        "content": "      Honestly, if you told me this would be one of my favorite games a year, or two ago i'd laugh because of how much of a buggy mess it was. While I haven't watched Edge Runners yet it's part of what got me to try it out since it got people to come back to it, and notice how significantly it's improved which eventually led to me finding out about it causing me to take an interest in the game again. Now like all games it ain't perfect, and never will there are still it's fair share of bugs, but the game is playable, and it generally wont mess with your experience, I've done a full play through explored alot of it's content, and haven't really discovered a major bug that stuck out to me. With bugs aside though the game has an excellent story, it's an emotional roller coaster with one of the coolest intro's i've experienced in my opinion. I enjoyed, and had fun with the combat it's fun testing various play styles, and using a rather large assortment of weapons, and cybernetics. As I said the combats fun, but it's not really ground breaking, melee combat is similar to Skyrim, but is improved, polished and has more too it. Gun combat is likely what you'd expect, but I personally found it pretty fun experimenting seeing what I could do, or pull off with guns while using the Sandevistan like shooting grenades mid air to set them off earlier and other things.  The main cast of characters you'll be interacting with are good, they usually have a good questline linked to them, and make some small appearances in some quests while in some cases they can alter the ending of the game, or give you a different ending option. As you likely already know Keanu Reeves plays a significant role in this game being Johnny Silverhand which he nailed, did an excellent job with I really enjoyed the role he played, and found him extremely interesting. Personally I tend to take high interest in the sound tracks of game, shows, and movies so I always appreciate a good soundtrack which they didn't disappoint me with this games sound track at all, I can't speak much about the raido stations since I didn't listen much to them, but I enjoyed most of the tracks playing throughout the game. Overall ignoring bugs, and past issues this game had i'd give this game an 9/10 on the game itself, and a 10/10 overall the last game that got me this hooked with it's story was probably Red Dead Redemption 2 while it'd likely place in 3rd or 4th place for my favorite games of all time.",

Choice and consequence is present, but don't expect it to be on the same level in that regard as the Mass Effect trilogy, Fallout New Vegas, or other similar RPGs. CP2077 also excels when it comes to atmosphere. If you like the visual style and feel of Blade Runner (OG & 2049) you will appreciate this. Would recommend.",

So what was my big draw?\n\nThe big draw that kept me playing was the immersion. This is a combination of the graphics with RTX, incredible voice acting, and the attention to detail to the characters. I romanced Judy and the story line with that was amazing. The icing on the cake was the detail that CDPR added after that story arc. I don't want to spoil anything, but sufficed to say adding the options to continue interacting with characters that you've grown to love is something every game developer that cares about their players should. To me this is a selling point.\n\nReally, any problems I had with Cyberpunk are problems/tropes I have with the genre in general. The only thing I'll mention in particular is guns. It always annoys me to no ends that guns of the same caliber do different damages (at least dramatically different damage, because there's a tiny variation).\n\nSeriously though, amazing immersion, storytelling, characters, and an engaging plot that isn't flat.",

Sometimes details don't load right away, leaving characters you're talking to (or trees/plants) as vague, blurry blobs, but that usually corrects after a few seconds. Less technical side, there's little to indicate if some side missions are too dangerous for you until you try to tackle them and get wrecked. Maybe that last one is more my fault than the game's though.\n\nIn general, recommend playing it. The problems are mostly minor, and even the bigger issues are far between. The game's a lot of fun.",

        "content": "I purchased this game probably a year after it was released (when I finally managed to get my hands on a new graphics card), so I missed all the initial mess, and the game was much more complete when I played it. And I enjoyed it well enough for its story and game play. I got almost to the end of the game before I got distracted by something else and put it down, until like so many the Edgerunners anime on Netflix sparked my interest again and I came back to it and started over from the beginning. This time I played with mods installed, which I highly recommend. The vanilla version is good on its own, but mods let you tweak or change all the little things that annoy you.\n\nNow the game:\n\nThe story is decent. After the first few missions of the game which serve as a sort of prologue before the entire map opens up, the story centers around you trying to find a way to remove Johnny Silverhand's (Keanu Reeves) digital ghost from your brain before your entire psyche is overwritten and he takes over. New friends are made, enemies are faced and defeated, and there is even a chance to enter into romance along the way. The usual stuff. \n\nI feel they missed an opportunity with the three \"life paths\" you choose from in the beginning. Other than a few dialogue options, and an initial starting mission, the different life paths don't really offer any real differences. All the quests are available, and I believe all of them have the same options for completing them, and all the endings are available from each one. It really takes away from the replay value.\n\nAs many have said, it's a little disappointing to go through the process of character creation when the only time you get to see your character is in the menu screen or when riding a motorcycle. A few mods have attempted to implement it, but the animations look silly. Considering games like Skyrim have achieved first-person-to-third-person modes of game play you wouldn't think this would have been that big of an ask.\n\nI also wasn't very happy with the driving in the game. The steering felt really sensitive, with the car whipping back and forth when you try to steer at high speed. I found motorcycles to be way more responsive. And it's way easier to drive using an X-Box controller than mouse and keyboard. Fortunately you can switch between them seamlessly.\n\nThe game looks good, graphics-wise, although your mileage may vary depending on your hardware.\n\nThere are tons of mods out there for this game now too, from graphical enhancements to quality-of-life tweaks that make it more enjoyable. \n\nBut anyway, to sum up, what started as an over-hyped disappointment has become a pretty enjoyable game worth playing.",

I am not a fan of cyberpunk theme so that made it even worst. But after the anime, everything got better and this is definitely deserving some recommendation to others.\n\nPros:\n1. Fun hack and slash and shooting gameplay\n2. You can create a lot of different fighting styles\n3. There are mods that allow you to turn on console (Definitely a perk when it comes to single-player games)\n4. So many different car choices and apartments. (I definitely love these. Driving around fancy cars and living in modern style apartments)\n5. Storyline is engaging.\n6. Allows modding. (Definitely a plus since that's how Skyrim kept me for so long)\n\nCons:\n1. [spoiler] Not a fan of bad endings. This game literally has no good ending >.>. [/spoiler] (Just why would you do this to me) \n2. Character customization could use some improve. (more choices for looks please. Really hard to make someone who looks appealing)\n3. Need better clothes (Get better looking clothes please, the ones in game aren't good. I want my character to wear a pretty dress and slay or good looking outfits for guys)\n4. The driving in this game is hard like GTA. Too easy to bump into things\n5. More weapon and body modding would be nice. (Don't get me wrong, there is currently a lot of selection already, would be nice to have more though)",

        "content": "I have to keep fighting the urge to restart the game to do better. Its really hard to know what direction to go in first because the game has event scenes and conversations that make me think I missed something or I'm doing stuff out of order. Which is weird because the game really wants to be on rails judging by how it wont allow me to switch off job indicators on the map to free roam. You can free roam, but your mini map will always be pointing you in the direction of the job you should be doing. \n\nBuilding an effective V is difficult as well. I feel like the game leans heavily in favor of hacking builds and hates on gun play. I just wanted a heavy shotgun build, but I can't kill anything with less then 5 shots unless I'm standing inside it. Or I spent 5 minutes hacking, blinding and turning off cameras. I've tried dumping my skill points into just the shotgun or even using other weapons but it detracts from the abilities the game obviously wants you to favor. \n\nGames on PC, to my knowledge, have never done cars in games like this justice. I have two speeds in any car I'm driving in a game I play with a keyboard. Go and stop. Why not make the wheel on my mouse the speed of the car. Roll up to accelerate, down to slow. I can't possibly be the first person to think of this or who hates launching from a dead stop into a wall.  \n\nGames not bad, I'm trying to get use to how it wants me to play as opposed to how I want to play it. ill give it more time before I call it a bust. I did pay for it on sale and I'm already getting annoyed I can't do what I want with my class. So take that into account I guess. I also ignore the bugs, so there's that too.",

I feel like this game had much bigger potential. \n- Visually it's stunning, \n- The story is pretty interesting and unique.\n- Amount of content is very large.\n\nBut... something, something isn't right. It feels like it was released unfinished. I don't mean technically, I saw minimum amount of bugs and I even play it on Linux. I had strange taste after finishing the game. Maybe first time in my life I had feeling there was just \"too much stuff\" \n\nFor me, it looks like all the guns looks same. And I would also say there is too much stuff you can pickup or interact with. Sometimes you just don't want to open the twentieth box you see in the room.\n\nAnother thing, I was pretty confused with the clothing. I was trying lot of armors I have found, but my character still looked same. I know I probably didn't understood some mechanic, but it was just confusing.\n\nAlso I'ts nice you gathering some \"reputation\" in the game, but I didn't see any changes in the world. In stage where I had 90% reputation there was just one dude whose behavior change like in minimal way. (he started to greet me). Maybe I am just incautious, but I had feeling that world don't reacting to my actions. - I don't count \"news\" on the loading screen.\n\nI don't think I will play it again, but I am glad I play it once. In the end it wasn't wasted money. For me 7.5/10\n\n",

From the very first time I played cyberpunk the day after it's release to today almsot 2 years later the game still a emotional rollercoaster. It'll make you truely think about your life and your purpose.\nThis game still might have a few bugs here and there but overall it's one of the best games I have ever played in my life. Hope this game and this genre stays alive for a very long time. And serve as pure nostalgia one day.",

The main quest has some great moments, and some of the sidequests are absolutely amazing.\n\nBe warned, however, that Night City is a futuristic dystopia, with all the trappings that go into that. You'll see sex, drugs, and violence everywhere. If you're not okay with that, this isn't the game for you.",

However, I expected such \"minor\" glitches and bugs and played on. The bugs and glitches I encountered, later on, were also on the same level as these. However What broke the camel's back was the horrendously bad-made races, I will just say rubber banding.\nI finished the game's main story and a decent amount of the side quest. I lost interest in buying all houses and cars because of the money glitch I encountered by accident.\nSome nice things were the references and easter eggs to the Show Edgerunners, I appreciated these. \nAs Conclusion I can say, don't buy the game at full price buy it when it's on sale for like 50% if you want to play.  \n\n\n",

The best thing about the game is that it gives players the option to complete objectives in different ways, reminiscent of the Deus Ex games that came before. It does, however, lack some of the polish that the Deus Ex games have in level design. And although has a come a long way since its launch, there are still a lot of bugs.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk is a very ambitious game that tries to have a strong storyline like Witcher 3, with an extensive worldbuilding, and also an open world that feels alive like GTA or Red Dead. \n\nThe storyline is strong, albeit not on the level of extremely good like Witcher 3, but most of the sidequests can be interesting and makes you think about the fucked up world of Cyberpunk. Gigs are one of the core timesinks in the game, small sidequests with a story you can get into if you like to read texts and small details but if you just like to run and gun and listen to dialogue, you can still understand it and have fun with the gameplay.\n\nOn the worldbuilding part and having it feel alive? It fails heavily on it.  I'll not discuss the buggy parts since that has already been discussed to death by everyone else but the perfect description for Night city would be that it is a very beautiful art piece, but not one that can be interacted with. AI for NPC's is bad, and also extremely buggy. They don't actually do much and you can't interact with them. NPC Variety, and most importantly, all of the enemies feel the same. A lot of gangs with very different stories and styles were always hyped up in the trailers but ingame, theyre pretty much all the same and there aren't much interaction with them. Just enemy A and enemy b with different clothings. Could have had a good faction system with influencing the gangs that there is a lot of thought to  but not noticeable in game.\n\nWorth it to buy on sale, the experience is fun, and the main quest is fun with Johnny (Keanu Reeves) being an interesting companion for the whole game.\n",

I'm rocking a 12700k and a 3090 ftw3 so i shouldn't have any issues; not oc'd and up to date and still crashes every 20 minutes! \n\nPlease do better, cant recommend until i can go a full session without it dying",

Driving is awful (and a very large source of the previously mentioned bugs), altogether not good, but at least some gigs have someone else do it.\n\nI can't speak to the whole story so far. If I make it to the end and it makes the game worth it, I'll edit this review.\n\nGames does look pretty good when all goes well, characters so far are cool. Combat is kind of ass, but not the worst.\n\n\n",

        "content": "The game is fine but has so many problems even after all that has been done to it. If you are purchasing Cyberpunk 2077 because of Edgerunners you will be disappointed. If anything Edgerunners is more accurate to the source material then this game.\n\nFor one, while visually striking, Night City is a very empty place. Driving around is also annoying since the AI drives so slowly and will crash into you constantly. This could have easily been solved by simply expanding the road to make passing other cars easier.\n\nNext, there is too much side stuff that ends up being repetitive, slowing the game down, and also provides a disconnect from the story. I don't think the game needed around 160 NCPD scanner missions where you enter an area, kill all the enemies and then leave. Also, instead of having 100+ gigs that have the same problem, just create 20 that are well written and interesting. After slogging my way through all of the side content I just wanted the game to be over.\n\nAlso, this game is not an RPG. The \"Role-playing\" is very weak and honestly should have been like Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nLastly, the story is very weak. I never like plots where there is a time limit that never matters since it creates a disconnect between the player and the story. The first act is probably the best and I wish they stuck to that instead of changing it to incorporate Johnny Silverhand for no reason.\n\nThere are so many other problems like the various bugs that are still present but that would make this longer then it needs to be.\n\nOverall, Cyberpunk 2077 should have just copied the tabletop RPGs that it is based on. It's a good game that will never reach the full potential it should have.\n\nGive it a shot.\n\n7/10",

Combat was fun and basically turning myself into Wolverine was a blast.

The visual spectacle is unlike other games I've played.\nCombat balance on higher levels suffers slightly but it's not anything mods can't fix.\nIt runs extremely well on rtx 3060, on 1440p ultra and rtx on, dlss off, no drops below 45 fps, even in the middle of action.\n\nAs for bugs - yes some remain, like an npc t-posing in the middle of the street, or car spawning above street and falling down. I've encountered singular occurences, it didn't really break the game or stop story progression.\nAny gamebreaking issues I've had were caused by mods and went away when I disabled them, so be mindfull of how you mod the game.\nLong story short - beloved by everyone Skyrim has more bugs and issues than I've seen in 1.6 CP2077.\n\nI'm really glad CDPR finally fixed Cyberpunk and I enjoy Cyberpunk immensely",

V's story was amazing, don't get me wrong, but they're treated as nothing more than your average muscle for hire, which I found exhausting, since I've found the most fun as a netrunner.\n\nI also found it disappointing that your choice in \"class\" really only affects the intro, and some dialogue options. wouldn't it have been cool if it affected major plot points? maybe, in street kid, your previous trip to Atlanta could've caused some people to come looking for you, giving us a fantastic questline, while also answering the question of \"what did V do in Atlanta?\". maybe those guys who terminated you, and tried to kill you, in corpo, could've come back to finish the job. I want to see my choice really affect the world I'm playing in, and for me to be a former Arasaka employee, and have no one care? it seems kind of empty.\n\nmy last gripe is very trivial, so don't expect anything profound. I think there should be more additions to driving. I don't mean different cars, or flying vehicles, or even NoS or anything. why can't I use my turn signals? why can't anyone? why do traffic lights turn green almost immediately when I come to them? it breaks the immersion, for me, and makes driving feel unsafe. \"no, I don't want to drive! some asshole's gonna take a blind left turn, and wreck my car!\" the fact that I'd rather fast travel than drive really makes it hard to care about buying other cars.",

        "content": "I bought Cyberpunk right after Edgerunners released, I played a bit, then decided (with some recommendation from a friend) to complete the series before continuing the game. I have to say that Edgerunners made me open up my mind after refusing to purchase this game when it was released (and filled with bugs). I'd say that I love Cyberpunk 2077, I liked its theme since the E3 announcement, but led to disappointment when it released, but with Edgerunners, I finally played it.\n\nWhat makes it bad is the immersion-breaking bugs, like.. bug that make NPCs teleport during the story and cars popping in-out in the city. I think the story, theme and songs all contribute to the immersion, but are broken easily with those bugs.\n\nAfter I played it, I can recommend to my friends, but I'll have to say that they have to \"ignore\" the bugs, and focus on other aspects of the game to enjoy. Note that, it took me quite long to finally look past it.\n\nOverall, good stories, had many beautiful moments, soundtrack is a blast, some bugs kills immersion. Would recommend.",

As depressing as NC is, it doesnt come close to knowing what this game could have been. \nYou'll get out what you put into this game; if you buy into the vibe then you'll have a good experience even though there are a lot of discordant story parts that really take you out of character and make it seem like you havent made any of the choices you've made so far. \nI like that Keaneu was in it, but it could have been anyone else, too. I feel like some of the story beats changed after the lines were voiced but because of the high profile and likely high cost, they weren't redone, and it really shows. The mood can change 4 times in 3 lines sometimes, and it's a little jarring.\n\ngame is fun, buy it on sale and you wont be disappointed if your pc can handle it.",

        "content": "Didn't follow any pre-release promotional stuff, so I'd say I'm not among those that were overhyped. \n\nTried out the game after 1.6 released. \n\nMy experience with Cyberpunk 2077 is comparable to a fancy visual novel with a very dark and sombre undertone. \nThe game is functional, and combat is fluid. I had quite some fun - either going in gun blazing, or assassinating. Driving around Night City at night was exactly the rush that I expected, a gorgeous experience. Side quests are either nice or amazing, great stuff. The emotional moments, especially the death of[spoiler] Jackie [/spoiler]and the ending(s). They hit me quite hard. It wasn't a crying-my-eyes-out kind of emotional, but it did hit me deep.\n\n\nNow... here comes the grievances:\n\n- [b]The game felt very short [/b]in comparison to Witcher 3 and Skyrim. Really tried to convince myself otherwise but I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish there were (a lot) more to experience and explore. I really, REALLY wanted to participate and experience the opening half-year sequence of events with Jackie, as GAMEPLAY, not a montage. I am aware this is most likely cut content - their conscious decision, 'unfortunate' is all I can say.\n\n- [b]Progression made little sense[/b]. [spoiler]After the heist, V's life is on a timer, [/spoiler]yet I have the leisure to be allowed to pursue romantic interests and do boxing. The game seems to have not made up its mind whether to pressure me into rushing or giving me free rein. [spoiler]Also, by having Takemura kill off Dexter, I feel like I lost my most urgent goal of vengeance, felt very disappointed.[/spoiler]\n\n- [b]Story's pacing felt off.[/b] [spoiler]So many interesting characters got killed off early - if not too many. I got left with 4 romantic interests, 2 which are locked without mods, and Takemura (whose interactions with you also ends after a couple of main quests). Now I'm left with a bunch of whoever the f- fixers and a bunch of newly introduced characters that only ever get a chance in a side quest.[/spoiler]\n\n- [b]Different life-paths made essentially zero difference in gameplay or story throughout the game.[/b] 90% of the differences are inconsequential dialogue choices asaik. Chose Corpo, and I really wish I could play more corpo-rat V: the setting was interesting, there were immediate goals, and I could smell the incoming dilemmas. In the end, I got only a weak whiff of what Corpo V could have been.\n\n- [b]Main mechanics are dormant and un-impactful.[/b] This is the most frustrating complaint I have about the game. It felt like the devs came up with many good ideas for the game: relationship progression, health deterioration, lifepaths, time sensitive crisis, reputations, etc. But they just ... idk, don't click together that well. They all could have been valid and engaging core mechanics, yet they barely interact with one and another... and most importantly, NONE of them are meaningfully integrated with the main story, and it devalues all those mechanics as a result, stripping them any value they would've had. \n\nOther than that, the game is playable, and you will have quite some fun if you lower your expectations. Plus, it seems like the 1.6 patch Cyberpunk is far better than the Cyberpunk at launch, so I won't complain too much, every big game's got its flaws, and this one's just easier to spot. I'm also aware that many of the issues I've raised is likely due to the process of cutting content last minute, leaving many parts of the game hollow husks that remain, but soulless.\n\n\nTLDR: The game's alright, although undoubtedly with many many could-haves. Obviously rushed/unfinished, and I would not have put 'recommended' if it weren't for the bits that did shine through. 6/10.",

        "content": "The gameplay is really good in this game. graphics are solid and decent story line. Having mods in this game however is a pain in the ass. There are still some pretty severe game glitches though with saves not working, characters going through buildings which sometimes prevents a mission from finishing, several game crashes etc. This game has lots of potential and I think it is good on sale but in the state that it is still in, in 2022, I wouldn't buy it for full price. That being said it's really fun and mods can make it much better so hopefully they keep putting out fixes.",

Easily over 70+ hours of content each play through with plenty of replay value.  \n\n9.5/10 as it is now but they are continuing to update the game to make it run better and add new content.",

Finished the game, liked it. Started a new run at the end of -22. \nNow they have patched up the game and made it even more smoother to play.\nYes, there is untapped potential in this game.\nStill it was and it still is an entertaining game with good story and where you can create your own way to survive the streets of Night City. Would it be melee, ranged, stealth or via hacking, all of the paths are fun in their own way. \nOnly big negative from me to this game is the lack of verbal choice to approach the missions. You can sneak in, you can hack yourself in, you can break through the doors or even tinker your way through obstacles or just rush in guns blazing yet what is missing is a verbal, \"Charmisma\" or \"Cool\" way to progress through missions. We have lot of violence yet it would be so much fun if you could have a way to try figure our how to verbally get a chip or verbally try make a target surrender or just cheat and make fool of the enemy via deception. \nWill the incoming DLC offer something like this for us? We will see.",

Getting lost in the city is easy enough but you'll find that you are losing yourself in the City and its rich characters. The stories and voice acting are exceptional! I would recommend playing with the female V voice. While both are good the female voice actor takes it to a whole new level. \n\nSee you at the Afterlife, choom.",

        "content": "This game had a rough start, but it has come a long way. Cyberpunk 2077 is easily one of my favorite games now. \n\nPros:\n-The story is absolutely amazing, it is full of twists that leave you not knowing what to expect next.\n-All the characters are unique and interesting, each with fun quests that present options for determining their outlook. [spoiler] There are several romance options that can add spice to V's life as well. [/spoiler]\n-The gameplay is a lot smoother than it was, the devs have done a great job making it enjoyable.\n-Character progression has lots of options, each path you can take when developing your character has different strengths and weaknesses. \n-The setting is completely unique and interesting. Not once did I ever question anything about the setting. I was immersed in it from the start, and it never grew old for me.\n\nAs great of a game that I think Cyberpunk is, its not without its faults too.\n\nCons:\n-It still has bugs. I encountered many bugs in my play-through, but in 100 hours of gameplay (Post Patch 1.5) I only had 1 game-breaking bug that was fixed by reloading the previous checkpoint. Most bugs that I saw were just graphical errors, and most of the time they were self-correcting.\n-Where Cyberpunk's strength is in its story and characters, it lacks in features. While not completely feature-less, don't expect something like GTA V. The world is full of gigs to complete and bad guys to kill, just don't expect to be able to customize your car or play a round of golf in your downtime. \n-Night City can feel empty in some places, I believe this is a result of its rushed development. There are some parts of Night City that seem empty, or lacking anything beyond surface details, but it was rare for me to feel this way.\n\nTo put my review into final words, I would absolutely recommend this game for the story alone. The bugs are manageable, and were easily ignored for me. If you love a good story game, then Cyberpunk for you.",

I still feel like I have some qualms with the story, but the acting is really good, and I enjoyed the story regardless of my problems.\n\nNight City is extremely immersive when the bugs don't get in the way of it, and I think I heard that CDPR plans to continue making games in this franchise, so I can only look forward to it and hope they make an experience even better than that of Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend the game and I enjoyed my time with it. I think the experience is more than worth the full price tag.\n\nI just hope they add a NG+.",

        "content": "This game is the best single player RPG I have played in years, the game is worth your money and time now. The game is so much fun, I couldn't get enough.\n\nI initially avoided picking it up as I wait for reviews before I buy most of my AAA games. A story I hate telling, that this game has 'done a No Mans Sky' because of course it should have released in the state it is in as of 1.6. CDPR persisted and put their reputation on the line.\n\nThe story is phenomenal and drags you in. This isn't really a game to play while hanging out on discord or in the living room full of people, at least not in the first play through, you'll break your immersion and miss parts of the story and the great writing that don't deserve to be. You ought to let yourself get immersed in the brilliant world that has been brought to life and inhabiting your \"V\" for that time.\n\nThe voice acting is very good, each character is exactly that, a character - totally unique and exiting. Consider your choice when choosing what gender you are as it has a much bigger effect than any life path you choose. Female V's voice acting is incredible, she has a raspy/sexy/sassy voice that as a male player was great to listen to. Her voice also blends well with johnny's in those scenes - I feel female V and Johnny interact more naturally also, Johnny loves women, but his relationship with V is nice to think of as a character building/arc experience for him beyond the obvious. Her voice can dispense emotion when required but maintains the tough girl mercenary the game demands of V. The only downside of a female V is that you cannot romance Panam or Kerry - FYI Panams romance is worth doing for the art of it... My god. While you won't be upset with male V, he comes across as a real asshole - this might suit what you are trying to RP as though.\n\nThe writing and world building are great; this game takes you on an emotional ride. If you finish all missions and learn about each character, you will end the game feeling like you are saying goodbye to some real friends and villains. The scope of the game is humbling, you occasionally get reminders that V is still a shit kicker is a shit city even when you feel on top - that there is an entire echelon of uber rich humans living in luxury habitats in orbit and you as V are walking around alleyways with people immersed in VR masturbating. The game tackles serious themes, especially relating to the soul, transhumanism, corporate imperialism and addiction. I found myself pondering on the larger picture, like any real world set dystopian game it suggests a world that is possible. The final hours of the game are tear jerking, and the multiple endings are worth playing out a few times to experience them. The build up and execution of those final hours left me feeling emotionally exhausted in the best way. When you finish the credit scenes, all I wanted was more.\n\nThe Leveling and RPG elements work well together and are unique enough. You level up and get a stat and perk point. Higher stat levels unlock higher level perks in the tree. You level skills/proficiencies by 'doing' them - which unlock additional bonuses and occasionally perk points. As you do things you get street cred which effects what items / vehicles / jobs are available around the city. Higher cred = better gear and jobs. Unique items are plentiful and the game really does fall into that Morrowing/Skyrim/New-Vegas/Witcher 3 feeling when you start again - thinking a build up and going for iconic weapons etc. Customization is great, depending on how deep you want to RP there are enough character customization / clothes / cars / play styles you can really create anything you like.\n\nI cannot wait for more Cyberpunk. More stories in this universe, more mods and I can only hope we get spoiled for a paid DLC as impressive as Witcher 3: Blood and Stone.\n\nThanks CDPR for the best voiced protagonist for a long while, and the best RPG i've had the pleasure to enjoy for years.\n\nTLDR: \nIf you like games like New-Vegas, Witcher 3, Divinity 2, KOTOR, Skyrin buy this. \nIt is worth it full price, if it is on sale you are a nutbag if you don't pick it up.",

I appreciate the different things being said for different backgrounds, but it seems like most of the time I am offered a corpo dialogue option, its right where my Street Kid ones were. Maybe I have yet see the big pay offs, but 100+ hours in and they don't seem much different besides the actual said words. \n\n7.7/10",

Often you need to tap the movement keys to slightly change your position when sneaking, but in this game that will instead dodge you in the tapped direction, breaking stealth and ruining your positioning. Horrible design oversight.\n\nWhy does the camera insist on re-centering itself when I'm trying to drive a vehicle? No other game does this and it ruins any attempt to appreciate the scenery when driving.\n\nWhy is the minimap so tiny and unhelpful? It has no compass and is always too zoomed in for me to know what's around me or where I need to turn when driving.\n\nPatch 1.61 broke the game. Won't even launch any more. Reinstalled from scratch, all local game files verified, no mods, and launched directly from Steam. Still broken.",

Overall i have to give it a 7/10 because I do still get crashes frequent enough to be a noticeable problem and it being a slightly above middle of the road rpg with a graphical overhaul.  If you haven't played this game yet and are a fan of rpg's i would recommend this game but it's far from a masterpiece that I could recommend to everyone.",

        "content": "good game. 5/7. \n\nNo but seriously, Cyberpunk is great. If you like RPG's, if you liked the Witcher games, if you liked Edgerunners and just want to explore the world -  all good reasons to give it a try. Story is compelling, touching on some cool topics such as Cyberpsychosis. Not the best story you'll ever play, but if you immerse yourself in it, the ending(s) certainly packs a punch. I for one thoroughly enjoyed the story. \nThe experience as a whole definitely leaves some to be desired - no real police system, no vehicle combat (yet), not as many interactive spots or accessible buildings like bars or BD clubs as I would've liked. I don't expect to enter every building, but I would at least like to sit somewhere and let my character eat or drink. Combat is good, not great. I have the most fun with a blades build, so I would recommend that. Has a lot of potential with cyberware to be an interesting and diverse combat system, but like many aspects of the game, it falls a bit short. All in all, combat is enjoyable, but it's not on the same level as many AAA titles. Stealth is definitely encouraged.\nRegardless, I have nearly 500 hours logged and to this day I'm learning new things about the game and finding new places. I know many people knock the game for having unused parts of the map. I've never found this to be an issue. For me, the world is what keeps me coming back. Night City is incredibly dense and full of attention to detail. Some areas feel underutilized (Badlands), but never really dull. In short, if you're interested in exploring a cool world, it's worth trying for that alone. \nI have high hopes that continuing updates and the coming DLC will make this game what it was intended to be. As it stands, the game is great, but could always be better. Keep the updates coming, CDPR. (Also, mods are awesome and help with a lot of issues.)",

I absolutely love the Witcher games so I had high hopes for Cyberpunk.\n\nPros: Visually amazing and a vast array of different kinds of quests.\n\nCons: The dialogue. I cannot stand it - all the characters sound so freaking pretentious, especially V. Can't you just talk normally? Jesus. And the lingo that they use??? I feel like an old grandma listening to teenagers speak with words I don't understand - like \"virtu\" or \"BD\" and other terminology specific to this game.\nThe main storyline I also don't really get. I hope it will get better as I progress, but now it's a bit meh.",

I enjoyed more of the side quests with the people you meet in the world. \n\nThere are a ton of hours of content, but aside from the main story it's mostly side quests and mini side jobs to earn gear and money. Some side quests will have multiple parts like doing some races, or doing fist fights. I enjoyed the mini stories with these characters and some of them reminded me a bit of Witcher 3 side quests, which shouldn't be surprising.\n\nMods can help make the game more enjoyable with QoL updates. There are mods that add some fun things like hover cars, stronger cyberware, and reworked existing cyberware.\n\nTL;DR If you enjoy immersing yourself in a world and it's people you'll probably like this. Mods help make it more enjoyable. I personality would wait for a sale to get the game, the full price isn't that worth it imo.",

I enjoy the voice acting and the way you can play it however you like. I've always been a fan of doing non-lethal builds and despite not affecting the game much it allows me to do that here as well and even comments on it at times. Good game, fun. I had second thoughts about paying full price this long after initial release but it's been worth it for me.",

The story is fun (so far, not done), and the game runs amazing for my on my system (2080ti / i5-10600k / 32 gigs ram). \n\nThe visuals great for the most part. Game runs smooth, I have not come across any major issues or bugs, just the small annoyance of not being able tu run sometimes (fixed with a save game reload).\n\nMy one critique, is that the open world, and population is very stale in comparison to a game like GTA V... Not much \"life\" for the npcs.",

The game devours my memory even though i have 32gbs of RAM fast travel seems to be my best friend as driving becomes way too choppy on the screen. The developers are taking action to fix alot of the issues and bugs the game has but honestly its become too common these days for companies to push games out as if they are uncompleted and have just a basis of something you can turn on and hope it looks good enough to sell and worry about fixing it later on while charging the full price of the game even though its clearly in a beta stage of its development.",

It's still got some bugs and glitches but nothing game breaking. The scenery is breathtaking (Just like Keanu Reeves :D). Overall, It's still a work in progress but I would highly recommend it. Wait till it goes on sale for 50% off. Trust me it's worth the wait to buy stuff on sale ;)",

Gameplay is shit awful but story makes up for it.",

Great story and characters, very immersive. The voice acting, soundtracks, visuals are all the best out of the best. There are so much details to the game, that if you just fast travel to all the places, you won't notice. So please take time and walk around the city and enjoy the environment. \n\n93 hours in, I'm still on my first character. I finished the main story and important side character quest lines around 45 hour mark. Played The Sun, The Star, Temperance, and Path of Least Resistance endings. Spent the next 45 hours playing all other side gigs and NCPDs. Still thinking about starting a second character and play some more.",

I cant express how much that knowledge grinded my gears, making roleplaying difficult at times. Alas I got through a  playthrough.\nJust know that you are already dead. You are a zombie.

        "content": "I would say that this is a spiritual successor to Deus Ex. It feels more BladeRunner like. You're able to visit people's memories in the form of VR memories. The problem is that it's all main mission type of stuff... There's no point where you ever actually do that on your own, and experience these sorts of things without it being a main mission sort of thing. So each time it shows up... it's pretty much highly scripted.\n\nSpeaking of which... there is way too much dialogue in this game. Just skipping every conversation takes forever... It takes as long as any other game's movie clip... JUST TO SKIP. So... basically... try to think of this as a genuine attempt to replicate a real person's life. The play by play of it.\n\nI don't know... personally... I get bored with most  of the characters. I beat the game... and I didn't get much story except that I evidently contracted a second personality, I had sex with a really cool prostitute who was specifically programmed with my brain scan. And I guess I live in a satellite or sometimes.\n\nI just interpreted skipping the conversations as the main character being a psychopath and running on his own AI. Whatever personal information the world knew about him, it was just the AI doing it's work. He's just there to get his next kill. \n\nCrazy weird game.\n\nI generally didn't find leveling up all that interesting. It'd be cool to see people borrow from Deus Ex and Breath of the Wild in order to reduce the number of menus you need to be familiar with. Sometimes complexity can come from a simplistic presentation, is all I'm saying.  \n\nIt's also rather easy to level up in this game. \n\nThere's some BGS style hacking game play. Instead of knocking on a door or something, you can hack into their brain via blue tooth, basically, and blow out their optics, so you can run by or creep up on them for the attack. You can also hack a washing machine to distract guards and such.",

        "content": "The launch of Cyberpunk 2077 was, of course, disastrous and I probably would've never came back to this game if I experienced it at its earliest stage. I started playing about six months after release, and though the game was still rough around the edges, it was playable and mostly enjoyable.\n\nOne big problem I had going in was understanding all the language within the game, and deciphering the plot. I felt a lot of things were just skimmed over and there wasn't a lot of explaining. I was extremely confused about how Alt came to be an AI and what Mikoshi was, for example. I think the writers could've done a better job at explaining what all this stuff is and what it means because you can't just expect me to go into the game and understand. I had to do a lot of researching for it to make sense.\n\nAt times, the game is very cringy with its dialogue choices and tone of voice, but that's a minor issue for me and I've kind of gotten used to it over time. I also would've loved to see all the romance candidates be open to all of V's gender options. I don't appreciate the game not letting you choose your own pronouns and I think there should have been an option for they/them terms.\n\nI do have ideas that I think would make the game better, but I do enjoy it very much. I love the array of combat approaches and all the different pieces of cyberware we can install. I appreciate the options for stealth and I think the game does a pretty okay job with it. Quickhacks are so cool, along with the ability to gain access to cameras and drop enemies through their perspectives. I also love how many minor stories there are if you pay close enough attention. The gigs in particular have some amazing plots you may have missed if you're not very detail-oriented. \n\nOverall, I would recommend the game in this stage of development because I experience very little problems when it comes to crashes and bugs. I'll get the occasional texture distortion here and there, but I think the developers have done a great job at fixing the game and living up to many promises made by the marketing team. With the release of Edgerunners, this game got a second chance and I think it was well-deserved. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard on this game!",

        "content": "Just finished my first playthrough, which took 56 hours. I didn't 100% the game but I was pretty close, so I think I've seen almost everything the game has to offer which means I can now review it. I had great fun, I really enjoyed playing as a stealthy netrunner with suppressed weapons and lots of quickhacks. I felt the Fixer Gigs were a bit repetitive and that there were A LOT of them, but it stopped just short of being too many. I didn't care for the street racing side quests because the physics of driving in this game are quite realistic and well done, which means it can be challenging to drive with stability at high speeds, meaning I found the racing side quests very frustrating. I liked the character levelling system and the variety of perks and upgrades available to your character. I found the characters to be well-written and I got genuinely attached to some of them throughout the course of the game. I found it interesting that the game eventually takes on the aspect of the doomed protagonist like, for example, RDR2 does with Arthur Morgan. The difference is that Arthur learns of his doom late into the game when you're well-acquainted and attached to him. On the other hand, V's imminent doom is revealed to you quite early into the game (at least, in my opinion) which meant it didn't strike me nearly as hard as if the big twist were done later into the game at which time I would have grown attached to them. So I think this aspect of the story could have been done better by putting off the big plot twist until further into the storyline (e.g. a week or two after the Arasaka heist instead of immediately after). In any case, I thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough and opted for The Sun ending as I felt this was the most fitting conclusion for V's with the personality that I played them as. \n\nIf I had to give this game a score of 0-10, I would give it a 7.5 and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPG/FPS hybrids. If I had to describe it in a quick way, it's like if Grand Theft Auto and Watch Dogs had a baby. If you liked those games, give Cyberpunk a try!",

Combat is fun (if a bit simple) at a baseline, but falls off with low lategame enemy variety. It's really easy to skip fast travel, put on the radio, and take in the sights of the game while driving around to some synthwave. \n\nThere's a big gap in quality between the endings, but I can't go into it without spoilers. One (and a half) is a tearjerker and shows massive character growth and emotional impact, and the others all feel immature, cursed, or half thought out. Not all paths through the game are even close to equal. \n\nHad no bugs or similar issues.",

The gunplay is cool, the environment is well crafted, and the story is gripping.\n\nBUT\n\nIt's still a buggy mess. Multiple times in my playthrough, cars just *spawn* directly beneath me, models would T pose during cutscenes, a cop car in one cutscene got stuck as it drove away so i heard the siren over the entire cutscene, cops aggro me for no reason, one quest tracker refused to load, and a small number of purely visual bugs that can be easily forgiven. My main gameplay complaint is stealth builds are kinda bad because most enemies are grouped up staring at each other, preventing stealth takedowns.\n\nI enjoy the game so much that it pains me to give it a thumbs down. But, $60 is just too much for what it is. I got it for 50% off, which I think is a much more fair price considering the bugs and issues. A permanent price cut, or even a good bug fix update would immediately change my review to a thumbs up.",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 is without a doubt one of the best games i have played. From a writing perspective, this game is phenomenal. Cyberpunk managed to truly hook me and never let go. but that does not mean this game has no flaws. but they are few so lets get them outta the way first.\n\ncon 1: yes there are still bugs in this game. for example things not rendering, stiff animations and animations failures (such as mouths not moving when people speak), things floating in mid air. But its not really something that will take you out of the game. i have a pretty mediocre PC yet the bugs were not game breaking at all.\n\ncon 2: the streets feel empty and lifeless\n\nnow onto the pros.\n\npro 1: the story is absolutely amazing. throughout your entire run the main story never feels like its getting too slow, or tedious. And you get so immersed you can get lost on hours on end. And the side quest are the real icing on the cake. if you are going to play this game, do the side quest you want to finish first. like finish quest relating to some characters, make a romance story, pay off your debts, things like that. cus they will impact the way the story goes. and it will greatly enhance it as well.\n\npro 2: the characters. They are probably one of the most well written characters i have seen in media for quite some time. and not just V and Johnny. Even side characters like Judy feel so real its almost you personally know them. Like they are there with you. i know, sounds cheezy but its true. i cannot stress how much i appreciate the character development in this game. they feel so human, and your mood will genuinely change for the better when that one character calls. (for me, that character was Judy)\n\npro 3: the gameplay feels nice. The gunplay feels real and the guns pack a punch with every bullet fired. the cars feel alright, personally i like motorcycles the most, and the cyberwear weapons, such as mantis claws and the projectile system feel powerful.\n\npro 4: visuals are amazing. sure you might need high end computers to get the full spectacle of it, but even at a low end pc i still could really appreciate it.\n\nnow rapid fire.\n\npro 4: secrets all over the game that can change everything or nothing\n\npro 5: the bosses feel (mostly) great\n\npro 6: the world all around is very good. even tho its not dwelled too much upon\n\npro 7. most iconic weapons actually feel iconic\n\npro 8: the ending (at least the one i got) was just amazing, and i wont shake that feeling away anytime soon.\n\n\nall in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is a game that i highly recommend to anybody who wants to dive into a amazing story and let yourself experience a true master class in writing.\n\n9.5/10",

Leaves you wondering, imagining and thinking, that is what you want from games like this. All the endings were completely worth experiencing. The credits screen having many story important characters talk to V was a unique experience to me. Just f****** awesome.\n\nThe game also has amazing soundtracks and themes. So many I enjoy, while the average game these days just doesn't get anywhere close to these. \n\nStill got some bugs, but none really bothered me at all. Comparing it to what I have seen when it came out, it is in a good state.",

The world really feels full of life, the immersion is so good you really feel part of the world you're roaming around in. The characters you meet are full of personality and I really like the diversity of personalities you come across (Johnny the most of course). The guns feel satisfying, the hacking is good, you make so many choices and go through life however you want to whether it be good, bad, sneaky, full force, hacking, whatever you want. There's hidden paths in missions that can decide fates, the swords feel really good, and I feel like the game is pretty balanced in challenge . I really adore this game. It quickly became one of my favorite games of all time. If you're thinking about it, this is your sign. Get it!",

Literally my first time opening the game, in the cutscene where you and jackie are walking out of some building, they were t-posing the whole time!!! Regardless of how fun the gameplay is or how in-depth the systems are, I CANNOT recommend this game to anyone. In my 10+ years of playing Skyrim, I have encountered fewer bugs that broke the game than in the 40 hours of Cyberpunk I have played. Shameful",

        "content": "So I will give an overview of the game. WARNING SPOILER ALERT IMCOMING!\n\nFirst boot impressions: \n---------------------------------\nGreat character customization options\nFreedom to design your character 1000%\n3 starter options\nUnfortunate that character gender plays a role in the romancing of said NPCs (which isn't found out until post character creation)\nGreat Graphics\n\nNow we talk about play through!\n------------------------------------------\nOnce you figure out what gender/parts your character has you hit the start button and are immediately thrown into an engagement with a character. This could change based on starting choice! The fact that you can fully customize your character and pick your parts you have allows for a really fun time in getting to design a character that best immerses you into the universe of Cyberpunk. The only problem is forced censorship post character creation. This game is rated M for mature. And no one under the age of 17 can purchase the game. With that being said, it is horrid the amount of forced censorship goes on not only in the game itself if you try to go full nude but in the romancing scenes. It's like you spend so much time caring for this petty censorship on a game a minor shouldn't be playing anyways. If parents are buying this game for their children they know full damn well what they are doing. It isn't up for someone else to water down the content and experience of the game and the universe because some parents lack the ability to understand what this game entails. Moving on, not only is the game so free of character customization but that character is already destined and prewritten to romance only one npc on each end. I dig the representation of a heterosexual (Panam)  or a lesbian woman (Judy). But I never for one moment though that sexuality would have to be designed to please every singular sexual orientation. In a time where sexual orientation would perhaps be more \"free spirited\" in the sense that people love who they love. And that relatively decays the experience to the game. In a game where I thought the freedom of choosing who you are and representing that in a universe as vast as CP, you would think that forcing limitations would still be necessary. And for what? To appease some grown ass adult with fragile heteronormative views? Like the world of cyberpunk is no stranger to being future based. So why are we still holding onto archaic traditional sexual orientations. Why not design the game fully free of said limitations. You are hard limited on the decisions you can make and the many paths they provide in the game or not many at all. The first ending I got I signed the contract and was sent off to become a preserved consciousness. But if that is the direct main ending or the one that most will get when trying to see just how far the Arasaka stuff goes, why is it that there isn't any plans to further expand on that. Like jump years from like 2077 to a more futuristic time period that you get revived back into a compatible body? I would expect a continuation in that sense is definitely much more interesting than that where you just go into basically a sleep stasis, only, your consciousness was constructed inside a data shard to preserve your life. Refusing the contract you go home, and like the Hellman guy says, you die. \n\nThe game is amazing. The universe is amazing and very creative. But it puts so many restrictions on you from decision making to also needing to do a bunch of side gigs and jobs to be able to unlock weapons, cars, cyberware OS, etc. These are pretty boring and do kind of take a direct impact on player experience. I really enjoyed the anime for what it was but the ending again. Not everything has to be so dire, so tragic. I implore you to not get the game if you're thinking a good happy ending exists it doesn't. You die every time, in some way shape or form. There isn't much you can do to prevent it. It's like being handed a lego kit being told you can build anything but if you don't build what makes everyone happy then it was a waste of money from them to buy you the lego kit. \n\nI will say that the characters were really well done, the radio stations are superb. The only reason I'm down voting is to save other people time and energy. You will probably be better off buying the game on sale. Full price isn't worth. And if their 1.7 DLC is already as they teased. It's seemingly just adding another character to the mix. We have no clue if playable or just another NPC. I am telling it for what it is. The decision is yours to make. It's really great on the combat, really good on the story content (as long as you go in with very pessimistic mindsets). I await the day a game company puts out a title that fully understands that it's okay to push boundaries of creativity. Take out the forced paths bullcrap and censorship. Our paths in these types of games should be our own. \n\nOther than that this is my review. Take it as you will. \n\nTLDR; Game sets the illusion of freedom of choice but you really don't have it. And forced censorship. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

        "content": "TLDR; A surprisingly engrossing narrative with spectacular world-building and game play systems. Seems like a completely different game than what early reviews had described. 17 hours in and not a single bug.\n\nI had been following Cyberpunk 2077 since CD Projekt Red announced a new IP in the works. As a huge fan or the Witcher 3, I was sure this game was going to be incredible. Then it launched, and like many people I was put off by the reviews and the fact that early adopters claimed it was riddled with game-breaking bugs. Then things only got worse and CD Projekt red offered refunds to anyone who purchased it. I lost interest completely. \n\nThen, I watched Netflix's Cyberpunk Edgerunners and was so intrigued by the spectacular world building that I decided to come back and check the current state of the game. Many patches were provided since launch and most claim that the game had become completely bug free as of version 1.52. I was fortunate enough to get this on sale, but having played it I can honestly say that it's worth paying pull-price for.\n\nAside from world-building, the game has a great narrative and interesting side characters. Johnny Silverhand (Keanu Reeves) is a bit flat and stiff but that's a tiny complaint all things considered. The gameplay systems are incredible and rewards picking a certain style and sticking to it. That said, it's also forgiving enough to allow you to re-spec anytime from the main menu. \n\nI have yet to complete it, but the main story is not too long I believe. I've been so distracted by Night City and everything that it has to offer. From my perspective this is one of those rare games that's as long as you want it to be. Rush the story and have amazing 20-something hours of fun or explore every little detail and side quest that the world has to offer.\n\nHonestly regret not picking this up sooner but now might be the best time to get into Cyberpunk 2077.",

It's not bad, I have a mid-high range PC and get a solid frames after messing with the settings. I'm sure they're probably performance mods by the community or eventual patches that'll help by the devs.\n\nOverall, it's been solid experience, but expect a few non-major bugs semi often.

        "content": "The game is absolutely gorgeous. There's an insane amount of things to see and do. Lots of Easter eggs all over the place, throwbacks and references to fan-favorite games left and right. The combat is fresh and satisfying, and the cybernetic augmentations add a level of real time strategy into gunfights. The story line (I haven't finished the game yet) is interesting and deep, with player choice driving in game events and character development. Voice acting is great, with a few exceptions. The only real demerit on the game's record are the glitches. There are glitches all over the place, from characters walking through walls, objects floating in space, and scripted events clearly going off the rails. It breaks immersion to be sure, but doesn't ruin the experience. Overall I've thoroughly enjoyed the game, and will definitely see it through to the end of my first playthrough, if not more.",

The amount of bugs that exist in the game are about the same as any other game. I am sad they had a bad launch because CD Projekt Red is THE BEST game studio right now. Highly recommend this, and witcher 3, and I can't wait for witcher 4 or anything else they release in the future.",

There were some really good ideas here, a lot of em.\n\nIf you really want it, get it on sale. It's \"playable\" (PC), but I wouldn't call it good*. \n\nActually, kinda feel like I overpaid at 50% off, but, eh. I did finish it without feeling like I needed to just rush through the main story to get to the end (*cough* Witcher 2 *cough*), maybe more out of curiosity than anything. There were enough good bits sprinkled throughout that kept me thinking it would get good eventually, but really, they just seemed to highlight how weak the rest of it was.\n\nMaybe it doesn't help that I really wanted an option to flatline Silverhand about 2 minutes in, and the writing, even though you get dialogue options to tell him to fuck off, keeps pushing you to have a deep and meaningful connection with a person you can't stand to be around. He even gets really whiny about \"why don't you like me\" eventually. Absolutely pathetic. [spoiler] I took \"that\" ending, and they still forced a 'deep meaningful connection' moment when I just wanted to tell him to fuck off and go away. It completely ruined the only viable ending for me. [/spoiler]\n\n*The problem isn't just that there's still 'bugs', but that the execution of the world, story, voice direction, pretty much everything, is just sub-par overall. It's like they made a game because they had to make a game, not because they wanted to. I was hoping that the reviews saying the new updates made it worthwhile were right, but I think this thing was just cursed from the start, kind of a \"you can't fix stupid\" thing. The only thing that would really save this mess is to start over and do it right this time.",

        "content": "In my however many hours, I have done everything I could to get stuck and suffer the bugs of a game even masterfully designed and play-tested.\n\nI got stuck twice (merely had to re-load 5 minute old auto-saves). And all the bugs I have encountered were purely visual.\n\nThis game now lives up to 90 - 95% of my expectations before it came out and story-wise, often exceeds my expectations, I now think it to be one of the best games I've ever played. Takemura so far is my favorite character and one of my favorites in any game or even movie that I've seen, this game is just phenomenal theatre and everything I want it to be good at, it does wonderfully. The animation is masterful, the voice acting is masterful, the sense of scale is easy to underestimate if you've played R* games like GTA or RDR, I love the writing, I love the feelings and sounds and experiences this game gives me, I have only surface level complaints and for a game this massive, that really does speak for itself.\n\nEasily recommend to anyone 16+ and especially to anyone who likes good, unique stories. I'm still on my first playthrough as a \"street kid\" and the dialogue I've been having, again with Takemura especially, has just been so above and beyond what I have come to expect of open-world games. Maybe the best story in any game I've ever played and I have some other games that I really, deeply love, so to say that so easily ought to speak for this game well.\n\nOnly genuine complaints are: I wish there was more weapon variety and I wish there was more vehicle variety, or if that is not possible for performance reasons, then at least customization of one's own personal vehicle should have been included.\n\nI look forward to when they figure out how to get Delamaine working as your personal chauffeur, I absolutely adore just soaking in the city as it passes by, such a gorgeous environment, I feel bad every time I think about how rough the launch was and that I partook in mocking this now masterpiece of storytelling and game design. Will minor bugs still spoil the immersion? Sure. But if you can overlook them, something which hastily becomes easy, you will have one of the best experiences of your lifetime. I cannot speak for the other two playthroughs, but the contrasts of grit and hardship at the start versus the inconceivable wealth and luxury that surrounds you during your missions more and more as you progress and even during the initial heist, the drawing of attention to and obsession with nuance is worth every moment spent in-game and worth every penny.\n\nI bought this on discount but had I known how good this was, I would have paid $90 for this game and felt no regret.\n\nThe word \"epic\" exists for stories like this, and I say that as a space-horror and ancient mythology fan. Mechanically, top 10% of games ever made, story-wise, top 1% of media ever made. From twisted, gritty, stomach-churning, to expansive benevolence and exploration of the wonder that it can be and should be to be human. Stupefying grandeur executed marvelously, I haven't enjoyed a story this much since I was an adolescent exploring Fallout 3, a game which I harped on about as being my favorite story and game for years, even though I preferred Skyrim's world more.\n\nMy enjoyment of this game is like the feeling I had exploring Fallout 3 as a youngling with a world 15 - 20 times more pleasing, satisfying and in-depth in every sense than Skyrim. If you can run this game and know about it, you'd be an idiot to not buy it and play it at least once through. \n\nIf it had no bugs, more gun variety and vehicle customization, easiest 10 out of 10 rating I'd ever give, for now its a 9.6 - 9.7, though before I end my spewing of admiration: when story cutscenes occur, at times, it is a 30 out of 10. Introspective, philosophical, meaningful dialogue like this comes once in a lifetime...AND ITS NEVER WHEN I EXPECT. Takemura alone, 10 out of 10, I'd replay just to hear his dialogue again. Frustratingly good game, only because its difficult to condense into words how f***ing good it is at times. A *lot* of the time. You will have days where all you are thinking about is: \"What happens next?\" Or you are thinking about the dialogue you heard the day before, it really is that good.",

The bugs are normal stuff that you find in other games like Grand Theft Auto 5. \n\nThe visuals are second to none, though it is difficult to run on higher settings, as to be expected of a game throwing you into the new era of video games. I'd recommend keeping things on low if you want to play at your native resolution, and high if you wish to use FSR/DLSS. I highly encourage the latter\n\nThe amazing story that I mentioned earlier is the main selling point of this game, it really immerses you into the world of night city and makes you feel like you are one of the characters, especially given the high level of customisation. In fact, it was so immersive that for three days after I completed the game, the voice in my head was not my own, but that of Johnny Silverhand. \n\nThese characters that you feel you are one of, they all have unique personalities, appearances, and professions and or hobbies, all full of twists. You lose many of these characters along the way sadly, either being betrayed by them or betraying them yourself. It might not sound like a lot in a video game, but trust me, in this one it is.\n\n10/10, but not worth $80",

The game is absolutely wonderful. I try to walk on foot to every objective, just so I can look at the scenery and explore every area. The guns and weapons feel good to use (especially katanas) and the hacking is fun and feels rewarding.\n\nMy favorite part of the game has got to be the side content. The gigs and side quests so far have all been super fun and rewarding with loot and good pay. There are so many ways to approach a combat situation, whether it be stealth and hacking, guns blazing, or both. The game's loaded with references to other sci fi media and it's sick. The main quest is riveting so far and I feel invested. The sheer amount of clothing and body mods is almost overwhelming. I have encountered a few small bethesda-like bugs, but nothing major.\n\nThat being said, the game isn't perfect. Crowds feel kinda lifeless, there's no 3rd person mode, and the specs are pretty demanding. I play capped at 60 frames with an i7 9700 and an 8GB 2060 Super, and still get frame drops to 40ish frames in some areas. However, I absolutely love this game and everyone should definitely give it another chance :-)",

Almost feels like you need a hybrid controller. \n\nThe games not balanced at all. If you focus heavily into any of the trees you become a God at around level 20. The level cap is 50. combat, bosses, etc becomes boring even if the enemy is stronger than you because you will probably have a solution to whatever situation. The largest offender of this is Stealth and Non-lethal damage, which doesn't have any resistance and in many cases instantly knocks out it's target. Allowing you to enter a room with a cyberpsycho, snap your fingers and have them pass out without ever seeing them attack. \n\nOverall, games fun and with each patch and update it gets better. \n\n",

That changed when I had a friend, who rarely recommends anything, recommend Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the show on Netflix. Show was incredible and immediately ignited a desire to explore the Cyberpunk universe more. Bought this game, and since then it's been everything I've hoped and more.\n\nThe game is hard to play, not difficulty wise, mechanics, or bugs, but due to the content. It mirrors a lot of real life and is a real blow to the gut. It'll wind you, and make you sit there lost in thought for periods of time. Other times it's all wide grins and joyous laughter. Honestly? I think this is the most varied and engaging game I've played in quite some time... possibly ever. This game gets high praise from me. It's absolutely worth giving a try, and I don't think you'll be disappointed. Replay value is very high, storyline is great, and pretty much all around hits the mark across the board. Don't talk yourself out of giving this a go. It is worth it.\n\nExcited to see what else comes out from CDProjektRed in this regard, and definitely going to have to track down some folks to play the TTRPG with now.\n\nHope this helped. See ya later, Choom.",

        "content": "2 years after this game was released, at the time of this writing, Cyberpunk 2077 is in great shape: there're no game breaking bugs and there's a compelling story to follow. In some ways, this game reminds me of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines: has a great city to be explored, a very interesting world to dive in, great characters and convincing relationships. And very much like Vampire, I feel this game has the DNA to become a cult classic. \nIt falls a bit short when it comes to character class/build variety when compared to Vampire, but it delivers very well its first person combat. Guns are fun to shoot and melee weapons are great too, just don't expect as much variety as say Borderlands for example.\n\nImportant characters all have story lines that are nice to unveil (quest-by-quest), even though most of them don't feature meaningful choices that would alter their stories. There're some funny pop culture references here and there waiting to be found, and also all sorts of cyberpunk dystopian tropes. The writing is great, not up to Witcher 3 (imho) but still great. That said, don't expect to be guns blazing action heroing all the time, this is an RPG after all, and there're many moments where it asks you to sit down and listen to what characters have to say. Take your time to smell the roses. \n\nYou can expect about 30h of gameplay if you're mostly focused on the main quest. Which is what I did, then I went back for side quests, and played for another 30h at this point, and the side content is not near the end. There's a lot of content in Night City, and I find a lot of value in how it delivers this content, as small (quest) chunks. It gives you this feeling of progression even if you have only 30min to play.\n\nDespite its awful release, Cyberpunk 2077 now deserves another chance. \nCheers",

I won't speak much on the gameplay, the stuff may not be the best out there, though this aspect is \"good enough\" and enjoyable most of the time. Maybe some mods to spice it up would be something to recommend.\nNevertheless, the writing, voice-acting, all that shit? Man that's beyond top tier.\n\nYou know, aside from the start controversy (always be patient, you'll always be proven right), and from the crunch galore at CD Projekt Red (something something irony), it's a real good piece of software.\nBut, I played so much of it in so little time, I think it's time to go touch some grass and go back to working in the forest now.\n48 hours of gameplay at -50% discount, definitely worth it.\nWill be replaying it too, complete some other side stories I haven't bothered to because I got what I felt was \"alright\", and oh boy was it.\n\nReally really good game at a good price. Even, dare I say, full price might be worth it. I dunno though, that's up to you to decide, you know the worth of things for yourself. May be poor, more by choice than anything else, but if you can scrounge up the will and money, if you're into character-driven entertainment pieces, shit's good. Real good. Take your time and you'll enjoy the ride, and also, again, do get some mods to make the experience just a little bit better for you (if you know what you like).",

If you like the gameplay of GTA style games; driving around the city, working for gang bosses, shooting up bad guys, this is basically that with cool futuristic tech and Keanu Reeves. The driving controls are a bit frustrating as you can only adjust the sensitivity a little bit and even at the lowest setting, the cars will turn into a barrier or a crowd of people at the slightest touch. The optimization is such that unless you have a really good machine, dialogue will lag and overlap and NPCs will sit there waiting for their lines to load. But the overall story was very inspired, the gameplay is engaging, and playing around with the guns and weapons is great fun. 8/10 worth picking up on sale or something.",

        "content": "TLDR: Overall great game with a few flaws, definitely worth picking up.\n\nGood:\n-Story/worldbuilding. You can nitpick any RPG narrative philosophically but this is about as good as it gets. \n-Contrary to memes on the Internet, conversations often have branching paths that lead to different dialog and different results. I enjoyed going back and replaying some conversations to see all the options.\n-Visuals. World is highly detailed with varying indoor and outdoor environments. lots of color, lots of mood setting. Very pleasant game just to stroll through looking for trouble.\n-Environments. Lots of parkour which is surprisingly smooth most of the time. Also lots of empty open desert to burn rubber in outside the city.\n-Mission paths. Multiple ways to approach most missions that reward different playstyles.\n-Witcher-esque sidequests. every sidequest has a mini-narrative, usually told through documents, and those narratives often play off of the main story. Sidequests fall into a few categories so there isn't endless variability, but the differing environments and multiple approaches keep it interesting.\n-Build variety. Lots of viable character builds and all core stats unlock special dialog options and mission paths at different points. Cyberware system lets you add lots of interesting abilities and focus on your preferred playstyle.\n-Great audio engineering. The city is a cacophony of music, advertising, and human conversation. The badlands are silent and windswept. Pacifica is Pacifica.\n\nBad:\n-Still crashes too often for a AAA game.\n-Occasional bugs-- enemies failing to aggro, getting stuck in a vehicle, etc.\n-Some sloppy details in places. Blood stains that float and have a shadow, all motorcycle horns being the same sound, repetitive radio news broadcasts are unskippable and broadcast simultaneously on all channels.\n-Some things seem ripe for further development. Many cool cars, but not much to do with them aside from 4 scripted races that aren't very challenging. You can get O2 boosters for swimming but you pretty much never swim and the underwater environments are the same endless texture.\n-Some important systems are never explained. The outfit vs. equipment thing confused me for a long time, and I didn't discover the Upgrade section of crafting until the late game.\n-Hacking is fun but ultimately so powerful that it removes the challenge, even on Hard difficulty. Some nerfs like putting a cap or timer on friendly devices would be useful, or having enemy netrunners counter-hack things like turrets and cameras that you have neutralized or overload explosive devices just like you can.\n-Enemy AI stinks overall.\n\nAll in all, it's fortunate that I waited to pick up this game as I feel like it's a much more finished product now than at launch, and very enjoyable in spite of its flaws.",

This is a really good looking game, it's massive and filled with lots of detail everywhere, the soundtrack and audio in general is great. Of course, there are bugs, a lot of bugs, but for me, they were all mostly visual bugs, and the only thing harmed, was immersion. In the 48 hours I've played so far, I have not had a single crash at all, or any game breaking bugs, and for me that's the most important part.",

        "content": "Like so many others, I watched the cyberpunk edgerunners anime and really enjoyed it (you should watch it too!). I saw the game was on sale, so I figured 'why not?'\nThere's a solid 60 hours of game here, if not more. So if you can score the game during a decent sale you can hit the entirely-arbitrary '$1 per hour' critereon.\nIf you're looking for games with good characters and story (e.g. Witcher, Mass Effect) with a healthy splash of GTA then pick this up on sale. There's a really good game under here if you can look past the occasional Bethesda-style bug.\n\nOn the positive side, the story and world-building are top-notch, arguably the best I've seen in recent memory. The game successfully manages to walk the line between crafting a deep and carefully considered linear story while still allowing that all-important feeling of self expression with choices. Nothing felt 'forced' in that regard. They did an excellent job on the characters, I really can't overstate this. There's so many little moments of characterisation, and everyone feels fleshed out and real. I'm reminded of Mass Effect here.\nThe only problem I noticed was that your relationship with Johnny can sometimes whiplash pretty hard between the main story and side plots. One second you can be screaming at him to get out of your head, then the next your character casually asks for his thoughts during a side mission or something. The first time this happened was within the first five minutes of Act I, so there's really no excuse for it.\nThe gunplay is fun. This game has some of the best feeling guns ever. Heavy hitters like sniper rifles and precision rifles fire huge bullets and damn you can really feel it. I didn't touch melee combat outside of bare knuckle boxing, but the hand-to-hand was interesting enough to keep my attention through the boxing side quest. I really enjoyed the stealth aspect even though it was nothing fancy by itself, but hacking gives you some interesting tools to spice up both stealth and combat.\nGraphically speaking the game looks great, there's no denying that.\n\nIt's no surprise that the main drawback is the bugs and roughness around the edges. It's been two years since release and it STILL feels like it was rushed. Most bugs or missing features are pretty minor, but they all add up. There are some quite frankly obvious issues that really have no excuse for still existing at this point. As an example, there's only one 'animation' for getting out of your car, so even if you're going 200mph when you exit you just open the door, step out and immediately snap to the ground, completely stationary. The fact that this is still in the game at this point is mind-blowing. Another issue being that most objects are strangely difficult to select - sometimes you have to look not-quite-at something to get the prompt to interact with it, etc. Of course, there's also the classic janky 'vibrating car' that can happen if your car happens to spawn inside something when you call it. I also saw a couple of NPCs T-pose very briefly. Be prepared for Bethesda-level jank.\nSome other annoyances include the inability to put scopes or silencers on some weapons, for no particular reason, it seems. Also, some of the cyberware modifications you can buy are just... boring (or at least weren't relevant to my character). There are interesting parts to be found though, so keep looking. A lot of the perks and weapon mods also suffer from this - there are many that are just a small percentage boost, which is the opposite of interesting.\n\nOverall though, the positives far outweigh the negatives (which are mostly just me nitpicking). I bought it at 50% off and would happily buy it for that again.",

I've seen enemies just not do anything, at all, its weird. I've seen just random shit that.. honestly is kind of annoying.. would I recommend the game? to someone who loves the cyberpunk genre and saw the show, sure.. just be advised, this whole narrative of \"cyberpunk is now bug free\" is one hell of an overstatement IMO.",

        "content": " The art, the design, the fun game play are what really keeps me coming back to this game. Its basically a futuristic bladerunner GTA. The world and lore is enriching and pulls you in, its a cautionary tale to society today and the influence of corporate. The constant juxtaposition of nature and faith with AI and robotics is a really intriguing concept. The details in the city are endless and fun to explore. The character design and ability to customise is super fun like an rpg you can change your character completely to suit any style. The influence of Japanese aesthetics really just makes this game so beautiful and different. As an anime lover I am fulfilled in every way possible - plus the actual anime on netflix was really good. \n\nBut more than all that, this game is just so fun. The ability to customise, use different type of battle tactics (cyberware etc), parkour through the streets, drive a variety of vehicles. You can stop this game for a year and just come back when you want to shoot something, its just one of those games. \n\nI bought this on presale and played on release. It came out during covid lockdown and although this game was far from perfect then, it was my only release from a daily struggle of emotional stress and loneliness from being a healthcare worker in the worst of COVID19. It will always have a special place in my heart. I have replayed this three times each with different backgrounds (corpo, streetkid, nomad). \n\nMy only wish for possible patches in future is that in the harder difficulties they make enemies be smarter rather than just inflicting higher damage. AI with the ability to learn patterns and interpret what your character could do next would be challenging and exciting. \n\nThis game is my guilty pleasure. I look forward to seeing what the devs do with the DLCs.",

And due to the performance issues and bugs at launch, it didn't sell as well as it could, so development wrapped up and they're going back on their promise for delivering as much DLC as the Witcher 3 got, releasing just one expansion, and have already started moving on to the sequel. Sadly, this means that it'll never become what it could have been. Perhaps the sequel will do a better job.\nThere is a petition though to try and get CD's attention:\nhttps://www.change.org/p/cyberpunk-2077-deserves-a-2nd-expansion-2fd799a5-d204-457f-9a6d-33549fdc89c0/u/30971167\n\nBut the game IS fantastic, and worth playing.\n\nAt least with the sequel being in the unreal engine it should make it far more moddable.",

I keep telling myself that I'll move on to another game after this play through, but it keeps drawing me back in. \n\nAdding to this, is the thriving mod community, with lots of cool added content, that can improve on the experience even further!\n\nI also love how the game lets you reset to just before you enter the final event, allowing you to finish up any side gigs, or missions that you didn't finish before entering the final event. Because of this, you actually get a chance to do the final event in different ways, which can change how the final event plays out, as well as provide you different endings. I have already \"finished\" the game 3 times and am now on my second full play through. I'll probably play through a third time, so I can try the last life path out. I also have a couple character builds I'd like to try out.\n\nI'm truly enjoying this game! I highly recommend trying it out!!!",

Skyrim had more game breaking bugs and no one put it on a spike.\n\nThe theme of the game is beautiful. The attention to detail is wonderful. There are tons of little secrets to find, lots of random activities to do like random gang shootouts while you're exploring. The gunplay is just good enough to give you a sense that it's a shooter, but not over the top to make it frustrating, at least not on Normal difficulty which is all I'm playing on.\n\nOne minor downside I've noticed is that there is no penalty for stealing. Not a big deal, just means lots of free loot that I was going to steal anyways, so I guess it's a net-neutral feature because I do enjoy swag and not having to tediously pick it up.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that likes open world adventure games. It brings me back to the PS2/PS3 days which were filled with city games like GTA, Saints Row, Infamous, etc. If you like exploration and RPG character stat development you'll be right at home.\n\nAs a bonus, there are mods too, but I am currently not using any and still having a good time.",

Lies...Deception...\n\nSo far 2 hrs in (with 1 hr being character creation ofc because duh!) I have only managed to pass through the prologue part if I'm not mistaken and the cheesy training. I had 3 major crashes so far and after every single one of them the game verified itself (70 GB or so) and supposedly repaired itself for 15 GB without any download. I have seen 2 separate cut-scenes where everyone just went around T-posing and floating lmao. I have witnessed weird melee animations, funky rag-doll physics and so on. I only managed to use manual save once because for some reason the clickable slots aren't loading in often for me to click kek.\n\nHonestly it is amazing how a game is still in such a bad state with one patch after another. Performance-wise beside the crashes, FPS is fine I guess.Averaging around 70. I'm using an RTX2070S with medium settings overall and ray-tracing is off.\n\nYet, I still cannot hate this game because they tried something here and I can clearly see that even with 2-3 hrs of playtime. I hope I can jump back in soon enough to deal with more shenanigans thrown at me (hopefully in the game not trying to get in the game). \n\nA personal note: I want an extra option that enlarges the schlong so big that your default melee fist animations become dicc slaps. Thank you in-advance CDPR.\n\nEdit: I had a previous GPU driver version. Upgrading it to the latest solved the major crashing problem, fyi.",

After Witcher 3, this was definitely the game I enjoyed spending time with the most. With its story, characters and world, CD Project Red has proven again that they're the best in this market. You should definitely play this game",

The story is engaging and compelling, the voice acting is top notch, the graphics are stunning, the lighting especially is just amazing. I can lose myself for hours running around in this futuristic world. \n\nThe art design is some of the best I've ever seen in a video game. There are a lot of different areas and they look very different. \n\nThere are a lot of different ways to play the game. Like crafting? Tons of that and a logical progression. Game too easy? Turn it up a notch mid-play. Like guns? Go for it. Like melee? Go for it. Stealth? Go for it. NetHacking? We've got that, too. Or mix it up and make your character good at lots of stuff. Because you can change the difficult you can get wild and crazy and make a jack of all trades, pick specific things, or just randomly pick things that suit you in the moment. I think this one of the best parts about this game. The one thing I miss though is being able to respec your ability points in addition to your perks. Because of the higher perks you can really hinder yourself if you were going for something and didn't pay attention to how many points you had left. \n\nBut I wholeheartedly recommend this game. The team has done a tremendous job fixing the problems of the past, and the game runs smoothly and beautifully and gives me a gift: The ability to live in another world and be totally immersed in story, location, my character, and my situation. Hats off to the artists, developers, actors and everyone else involved in this amazing work of art. You have my thanks.",

But a great game gives you the ability to experience all of those things for the first time in a new setting with a fresh unexpected mindset ready to be blown away. Experiencing feelings, euphorias, emotions throughout the game that are so familiar but so different at the same time. These games are rare!\n\nGoing into cyberpunk blind with no spoilers or really any idea of what the game is, gave me the best introduction to the game.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is truly a action, adventure, RPG. Left me with a wow factor after 50hrs of gameplay time. Still excited to get home from work and see the story develop more.\n\nGraphics are amazing 9.5/10\nTalents and abilities are amazing 10/10\nStory and character development is perfect 10/10\nQuests and gameplay are immersive and keep you busy. 10/10\nSide quest NPC background is just as immersive as the main story.\nThe full control over players decisions play a great roll in all of this. One of the best free-will gameplay scenarios I\u2019ve ever seen. You actually grow relationships (good or bad) with these characters with an ever devolving backstory to each one. You feel every emotion you should to the characters. Every action you make plays a big roll in the long run in the constantly evolving story more than I\u2019ve seen with any other game. Best way to describe the choice options in cyberpunk is \u201cit\u2019s not so much black or white choices, or A and B options all the time it goes deeper than your average rpg\u201d.\n\nThis game goes on list with the best games I\u2019ve ever played. Along with.\nFarcry\nFallout\nElder scrolls\nMass effect\nRed dead\nGTA\nGames like these only come around every so often so I suggest buying it, playing it, and enjoying it. \n\n(Don\u2019t worry about what other people are saying when it comes to bugs/glitches/etc. every giant open world game has these and will be smoothed out over time. Take this game lightly and you will enjoy every second of it.)\n\nThank you Projekt Red for a great game.",

Picking different dialogue options and committing certain actions changes the outcome of the story and the amount of upgrades/weapons/equipment etc. exist, also add a lot of replayability. Although it is still very buggy and glitchy sometimes.\n\npros:\n- great story\n- amazing replay value\n- world building, nice aesthetics\n- attention to detail\n\ncons:\n- immersion ruining bugs/glitches\n- story is a little short\n\nconclusion:\nwould I recommend this product? Yes. Definitely worth your money and a great story/single player experience",

With so many play styles you'll want to have multiple playthroughs. Characters are amazing as well as the dialogues. \n\nThis game has a bad rep but I suggest playing it and experience it yourselves to form an opinion. I definitely didn't regret playing it",

Feels very lived in, reminds me of Just Cause 3 that way. There is plenty to do and ways to do it. The scenery is awesome. Run's great for me. It didn't take long, I was in Vortex mod manager making the game better with body and clothes mods. Tons of mods, however I did have install issues with quite a few, but it is early days for both for me and the mods. \n\nI did make the mistake of doing The Heist mission way too early, clear out the district before moving on. You can make easy money and get the mono-wire weapon among other things before Act 1 is done. I love the motorcycles, driving full pinned through traffic is a rush. The grind may get to you, but I started doing more gigs, on the way do NCPD and random bad dudes in the ally battles. By mixing it up you get loot and some story, so it doesn't feel so grindy. Then stop at one of many convenient Interact machines to cash in your loot. Teleporters everywhere too, sometimes it's easier to leave the car at home. Tons of crafting if you'd rather disassemble loot to make better stuff.\n\nProjekt Red seems to have embraced the modding community. If you want to see how to make a game better, give users the tools and they will show you how for free. Workshop content would be nice but Vortex bridges that gap for now.\n",

That was a really great way to ease someone into the game and heard that they had now done a recent update that made the game as a whole much more playable. I am 96 hours into this game on my first character (Streetkid) and I don't regret for a minute the money I put into this game. If I am less than a third into this game (3 characters) and I almost 100 hours of gameplay, that's money well spent to me. Not to mention not only are there 3 characters, but each characters playthough has many different branches it can go through. (Different love interests, how you help each person, how that effects your relationship after, etc.) If you like games with multiple endings, you need this in your life.",

Many are every bit as strong as the main story.\n\nBad:\n- Still has bugs that can ruin immersion a bit.  Nothing game-breaking I've experienced, and the game Autosaves a lot to make it easy to restore.\n- Music in the car is pretty mediocre.  Driving fast with good music is fun enough that this is worth mentioning. \n- Loading times are a bit long.  My PC is several years old and I have this game on a HDD.",

Some of it feels empty or underutilized. The final boss is fairly disappointing, but did not take away from the endings. I would have liked to see more choices that have a large impact on the game, and longer prologue sequences for the 3 life paths. I would also like for there to have been an iconic DB-2  Satara, considering how many other iconic weapons are in the game.",

        "content": "I was not expecting much going into this game. I hate the Witcher series. But I think that might be the key to liking this game, and the root cause of all the negativity surrounding its launch.\nExpectations were so insanely high from their fanatical supporters who loved their previous titles and thought this game would cure cancer. \nSpoiler, it cant.\n\nFirst off, Yes, there are still game breaking bugs 2 years after its launch. But now modders have made the tools to allow you to bypass any issues that could arise.\nI had a mission where a gate was suppose to open on a script. It didn't. There was even a website talking about this bug, and exactly what you needed to do to avoid it. Well, I had already triggered it, so nothing I could do but start over from the beginning right?\nNope.\nDownloaded the no clip mod and just ghosted through the gate and continued the story.\n\nSpeaking of which, the story is AMAZING. The characters are fleshed out, the voice acting is on point. Characters that you thought would be minor and shallow slowly gain depth through missions until they are practically the main characters best friends.\n\nAnother downside, is the map. Let me just say this. The map is awful. Its the worst game map I have ever seen in any game, ever. I am constantly lost. I never know where I am. This is a unique feeling for me because I am ridiculously good with maps and directions. Playing this game has allowed me to empathize with people like my wife who cant make heads or tails of any map and have to rely on real time directions from google or whatever.\n\nBut seriously this game is ridiculously good. The gun play is smooth and satisfying, the story is rich, deep and very long. Its more like a novel than a game. The characters rival games like Mass Effect.\n\nI love this game. Please try it, but go in without any expectations. This game will not change your life, but you will get WEEKS of high quality entertainment.",

        "content": "This game is wonderful, when it works. It's no Witcher 3, it's barely at the tier of Skyrim, but it's its own thing that is special. I started playing after 1.6. I have a beefy computer and even with everything turned to low, I barely get the 144 fps my monitor is used to. That doesn't even bother me as much as the CRASHING. This game crashed on average once every hour. That is, until I got to the Ghost Town mission, went to the hideout, and then it crashed literally every 5 minutes. The game became literally unplayable. \n\nLong story short, I don't think this game is worth buying or playing until it gets another major stability patch. For me at least, it literally isn't playable. I'm just glad I got it on sale.",

I'd say this game is better, by far, than many/any other game remotely like it a.t.m. Including Skyrim & G.T.A, Fallout.. etc.  Superbly written & constructed story narratives, character arcs, and world law to find and explore. \n I can only fault 1 thing frankly, not having a 3rd person option.  \nYour game, the building of relationships, character arcs, consequences to actions.. it's epic.  Very happy I got this. Steam Sale 24\u00a3.  8.5/10.\n Kind of feels like Mass Effect meets GTA in how it plays. \n\nO.K: 124 hrs & 1 play through of doing everything, of quests related content, is done.. including some messing about. Worth another play through too, but just doing the main story; as to do 'it all' again would be too much frankly. \nI'm reading that the main story can be gone through inside 25 hours.\n Looking forward to future dlc, and messing about with some mods now.\n",

I\u2019m glad I never played the game when it first released as it was a buggy mess, but the bugs are all pretty much ironed out now. You may have the occasional moment where you fly into the air when travelling too fast over a bridge and fall off your vehicle, phase through the floor and splash into the sea. But that\u2019s just Cyberpunk for ya!\n\nOh, and Pyramid Song is the best mission. IYKYK.",

        "content": "I have played this long enough that i believe i can confidently leave a review. First let me start off by saying that yes this game had a terrible launch, mainly due to the devs receiving death threats by parts of the community and a very pushy and demanding upper management/ investors. But they are slowly adding features that were promised during E3 which is awesome, along with a very strong and healthy modding community, this game has endless potential and replay-ability in certain aspects. And with the anime playing its role in reviving the game as well  i can confidently recommend cyberpunk to anyone interested in the game but were skeptical due to a poor release and other corporate drama if you kept up with it as closely as i did. Anyways heres my list of pros and cons \n\nPROS:\nOutstanding story, multiple choices, endings and three story-lines.\nLots of customisation for your character to make them truly unique and mods to add to that experience.\nAmazing voice acting and fun dialogue between npcs and interactable characters.\nBeautiful scenery and so much to see in night city even after completing everything.\n\nCONS:\nThe story is great and so is the side missions but i wish some of the missions were re occurring missions, definitely would add to the replay-ability for some players\nLack of vehicle customisation without the help of mods.\nStill buggy but lots of the game breaking ones have been patched, but some still remain but most are harmless glitches\nSome texture and graphical glitches in some areas and some floating objects that may or may not ruin immersion for some. \n\nOVERALL:\nI highly recommend this game even and look forward to the future of the game, especially with the new expansion coming out for it.",

        "content": "The game is great..... except two things. Driving, and combat on higher difficulties. \n\nDriving feels absolutely atrocious and I keep having flashbacks to Ryder's commentary on CJ's driving in GTA SA. Every vehicle feels like a drunk hog and you basically have no control over a vehicle if it goes any faster than 30. I really hope they'll overhaul it when the expansion comes out. Right now, every car I've tried feels about the same, and the same goes for bikes, which for whatever reason feel more like hovercraft than bikes. It's honestly embarrassing that this game has worse driving experience than early 2000's games.\n\nThe other thing is combat... more specifically, the BUSTED difficulty scaling that makes every enemy take multiple blasts in the face with a shotgun to put down on higher difficulties. I'm not kidding. At level 10 with fully upgraded (for the level, since it's capped) shotgun you need 2 to 4 point blank chest/head shots to kill an equal level enemy. Don't get me started when the game asks you to go into a zone 20 levels beyond you and you get into a fight against mobs with thrice your level. Any stray bullet 1 taps you while you need to expend an entire backpack worth of munitions to kill a single enemy (thankfully 3 of those were clapped by NCPD, but then they decided to take a smoke break and I had to spend about 80 shotgun shells firing my Satara through the wall at the last enemy because I couldn't risk a single return shot... and all I got was like 2k eddies total from selling the 4 lvl ~33 guns and the NCPD bounty). The bullet sponge is unreal, and I'm gonna switch difficulty to the easiest because it's effin stupid to run the game entirely as stealth hacker / neck breaker. Especially early when all you have is Ping and Distract and pitiful 4 RAMs. Perks seem to do nothing at all to help you in combat this early, as you'd need like 500% dmg and not 5/10/15 and whatever other numbers you can get early. Heck I got +15% against humans and +20% shotgun dmg on torso and I've noticed exactly NO IMPROVEMENT at all. Well, at least shotguns drop enemies to the ground, unlike the rest of the guns which do their best to imitate chinese toy BB guns. Tried a gun with a silencer too. All it did was alert the whole place to me while the stealth headshot took less than 20% HP off the same level enemy. I've seen more combat realism in Fallout 4, and that's saying something.\nI keep hearing that at level cap you get OP AF and 1tap any enemies and it MIGHT even be true.... but you don't play the entire game on max level, do you? Seems to me those people run into low level enemies and end up dominating everything with 1-2 shots like when you first control Johny in the Arasaka HQ flashback.. but yeah, at that point you got fully fleshed out character so it's a hard maybe.\n\nSteam says I've been playing this game for 20 hours. I believe 16 of them were spent sneaking around breaking people's necks (as the only viable way to progress) and the rest were reloading last checkpoint and cutscenes :S\nAh well, gonna lower the difficulty as it seems there's no real incentive to play on the highest difficulty, you get nothing extra for it other than bullet spongy frustrations. At least in Fallout you get somewhat better loot for it.",

        "content": "Having played the game during it's horrendous launch, Cyberpunk 2077 seems to have gained at least somewhat of a happy ending for itself. It still has it's share of jank and minor nuisances, but nothing deal-breaking anymore. As it is, the game is very fun and enthralling, although obviously far from what the pre-hype would've led one to believe. So if you can put all the pre-launch hype behind you, or better yet missed it all, I'm sure you can wholeheartedly enjoy the world of Cyberpunk.",

I really like a lot about the game and i thing its fucking beautiful, but what really got me hook was the story and characters.  for anyone who wants to kill a character off, for character development.  this is how you do it, you get to know them then you get attach to them then when the viewers aren't looking you stab them in the fucking backs and brake there harts.  so ya the story is really fucking good you will go though a roll coaster of emotions will playing not going to lie did tear up here or there.  my only complaint are the god damn cars i don't know if there are to weighty or what but you slide all over the place and you seem to never to able to turn tight enough.  ok ok one more thing there is a lot of menus i sat down and finished this game in to long streaming sessions and i probably used like 50% of them.  also the ability to turn off copyrighted music is amazing like why don't more games have that all you have to do is go into the sound setting and bam done.  ok so i could go on and on about what i do and don't like but im writing a review and not a theses. so in my PERSONAL OPINION so not facts or anything the game is damn good i can see some faults and some bright but over all i really REALLY enjoyed playing it.",

It feels really smooth/good with loads of build options. I personally went with a crazy streetbrawler build, baseball bat/knuckles with a fuckton of implants to beat people up xD\n\nWould recommend to anyone who was holding off buying this, its amazing right now!",

I'm addicted to night city now.\n\nIf you said that this game has a GTA-style open world and Deus:ex-style cybernetics I would already think it sounded great, but there is more. \n- The hacking is really fun to play around with and if you decide to invest in that route its loads of fun in lategame. \n- The leveling system is refreshing, its nothing sensational but I like it. \n- For the first time ever (I think). I have to mention all the cool outfits, I really wish I could get my hands on these kinds of clothes irl. \n- Story is damn good too, it really feels like your choices has farther reaching effects rather than just being one of 3 doors. Loads of great characters. \n\nTo sum it up: \nGame looks great, just great. I wish I could move to night city.\n\nThe story is captivating and I feel free to explore the world and the events however I like. \nFew games has mad me feel like all my decisions really matter.",

It definitely still has some significant bugs (scenes fail to trigger and progress to the next scene, leaving you quite literally stuck, combat music has got stuck requiring weird workarounds (restarting the game didn't work to fix it), NPCs rapidly transforming, some items glitched into walls, not receiving rewards from certain quests, etc. but the frequent autosave feature allows you to save scum out of those glitches when they do occur while only losing a couple minutes of activity, so you can work around it at least. They definitely have no business saying they're done fixing bugs, because the bugs are still significant and do disrupt gameplay at times.\n\nOther than that, the game itself is pretty fantastic. Shooting is solid, RPG mechanics are well balanced, story is very engaging and well written/acted. Stealth, slickness and guns blazing are all viable options in many situations. You really feel like a badass tearing people up in combat.",

There is still some minor bug, glitch but it doesn't affect my experience at all. The game run smoothly on my PC, combat feel great and it show that CDPR does caring about their game, their fan opinion. I think it worth to try if you did consider about buying the game and give it a try. Also, driving around Night City really chill and the experience is out of this world.

        "content": "The biggest drawback aside from the misleading launch, is that even with the 1.6 Update, the game is still ridden with bugs. Some examples still present in the game; \n\n-With DLSS enabled, there are very persistent and distracting visual artifacts in the form of flashing purple lights, always somewhere on screen\n\n-V's legs floating into the first person view while landing\n\n-NPC's wander aimlessly, often colliding with each other which results in a comedic display of engine phsyics as their bodies twist and contort around each other\n\n-NPC's will often phase into/out of existence, and will even walk into geometry throughout the city, things like light posts, street signs, billboards etc. It can be very immersion breaking\n\n-Cars drive aimlessly, and I have noticed a few occasions where the cars will thrust themselves into the pavement, and continue to drive forward with only their front tires on the ground\n\n-When selecting the option to change your appearance, the game will occasionally greet you with a blank red screen and no button prompts, forcing you to close the game manually and reload your save\n\nThe game is not perfect, but, that being said, there is a lot to enjoy with what is clearly a labor of love from CDPR. Highly recommend picking it up at a discounted price",

Other than that, I have been having a ton of fun in this game. It almost doesn\u2019t even need a story with how amazing everything looks and how fun it is being just straight up fucking reckless and completely insane in night city. This game is straight up 11/10 would buy again and definitely recommend.",

        "content": "I was one of the people who preordered the game, and its has its share of issues but at the root of it, Its a good game. The modding scene has potential (and I recommend you look into it, its super simple to do and can add so much to this game).\n\nI feel i need to touch on edgerunners but just to say, it really can kinda ground some of the things you see in game and help them make a bit of sense, at least more so then they would if you just played the game blind. Would suggest watching it.\n\nThe performance is a bit lacking. I have an AMD 2700x running about 3.8 and a GTX 1660, and I pull about 48FPS average in the game running at 1440P and a mix of high to medium settings (obviously no ray tracing). But im pushing my luck with this system, and plan on upgrading soon to fix this.\n\nOn that note, this game really can't look bad unless you play at a seriously low resolution. I seriously have stopped to just take in a view (I love to go to a certain someones apartment building to just sit around and fold laundry if I happen to be playing the game because of the view) and all of the character designs and art direction was done fantastically.\n\nWhile I understand that some people may not like it, the combat/progression system can be extremely fun to play with, and I think is one of the stand outs of the game, sadly I will say,  I feel there is a lack of repetitive content, which i never thought I would hear myself say. Eventually, you will run out of things to do in night city in a single save, and they're aren't enough hostile spawns or any other minigames of the like to warrent you sticking around once you finish all the gigs, side jobs, and NCPD Crimes. \n\nI don't run into any bugs that I wouldn't be able to chock of up to my mods at this point with patch 1.6 and this is coming from\n\nHighly recommend this game for people who enjoyed Mass Effect honestly, and I'm extremely hopeful for the upcoming DLC and whats this about a new game??!?! Hoping for quite a bit of new content in the coming years.\n\n(EDIT)\nAs of patch 1.6.1, and the introduction of FSR 2.1, I now get a perfect 60 FPS on the system mention above and it looks fantastic still, AND they added umbrellas. Honestly, got me even more excited for the DLC.",

Also the anime is the thing that made me but this game and I must say I havent spent cash and been glad for it so much until now, this is my honest opinion, but both the game and the show brought me amazing experience.",

        "content": "Still has some issues that crop up, such as character models T-Posing and mesh colliders not activating, but these honestly don't happen too often. The game is still largely playable, and so far, the story has been worth it. Although it can be disappointing to have a AAA game with so many bugs even though it looks incredibly polished whilst it is operating correctly, the game does seem to have many merits that counter these issues. The inclusion of a character creation system in which a player can choose a cisgender, transgender, or intersex character is largely a plus in my book. Character creation is also rather robust, and has many classically cyberpunk styles for fans of the genre. Gameplay and story are both immersive and do their job as entertainment.\nPersonally, I waited for this game to go on sale when I purchased it, concerned with the issues that had plagued it in its initial release. Having played through the first couple hours of the game, completing what would seem to be the Streetkid story's initial story arc, I would say that this, even with the issues that it still seems to have, would have been worth purchasing it at a higher price-point. As I said, it isn't perfect, but it is really fun to play.",

CDPR have done a great job of bringing fantastic world building and in depth(while broken at points) rpg mechanics to Mike Pondsmiths cyberpunk world. While I have enjoyed my time in Night City, I feel some of the npc interactions and gang factions could have been more fleshed out. Maelstrom enemies should have a much better time tracking/spotting you. Plus more mech/cyber types to fill their ranks. Voodoo Boys should be pulling more varied nethack attacks. Not just reveal location and overheat. It would be cool if someone else had a suicide nethack for a change. Animals should be hardier in general and should have more animal looking members in the ranks ect. I have been playing on very hard difficulty and have been enjoy the challenge it brings initially but felt like there was a layer to combat that was either cut or under developed that would have been a good way to separate difficulty levels. Looking forward to my second and third playthroughs with broken sandevistan melee builds though :)\n\n\nAlso driving is hit or miss at times. Bikes should be way more nimble.",

        "content": "I've really enjoyed playing this game.  Before I get into what I liked, let's talk about hardware and what settings to run the game on.  If you are wondering if you are missing out between the Ultra setting and Ray Tracing settings, the answer is no.  If you can run it at the maxed out settings with no issues knock yourself out.  \n\nFrom a technical stand point most if not all of the major game breaking bugs that made headlines seemed to be answered.  The only major thing I experienced was the game shutting down randomly, but that was my fault for not having something updated on my computer.  After an update I ceased seeing any random shutdowns.  \n\nStory wise.  If you just go through the main quests and don't do the side missions you will miss out on a lot.  The side missions help develop the game world and what Night City is all about.  There are also some fun Easter Eggs and nods to pop culture.  \n\nGame play, this will throw some players for a loop.   If you decide to just go charging in guns blazing you will get stomped initially.  Not saying you can't go the pure gun nut route, but you have to level into it.  The more perks you have in a skill the better bonuses you have that makes being a bullet tanking juggernaut of firepower possible.  If you played Witcher 3 you will feel right at home with the leveling and skill system.  Same with the equipment system.  Early level guns have low damage output, same gun mid game will have better stats and better damage output.\n\nPlay styles.  You can actually do stealth in this game.  It's reasonable stealth mechanics.  You don't have to do the insane planning that's required in the Hitman series.  You can also use on the fly hacking tools that supplement your covert style and in certain missions, going stealth pays out nicely.  Melee comes in some fun varieties, as long as you understand that distance is the enemy.  If you are clever with your movements you can end up catching two or more enemies in close enough proximity they are eating the same melee attack.  Gun play is pretty good.  You just need to understand there is no one gun fits all situation.  The best part is you can do a mix of these styles and your cybernetic enhancements and quick hacks can really make for some fun game play.\n\nBiggest tip I can give without spoiling anything is grind out all the side missions you can before getting into the main missions.  It's not even a chore to grind in this game because the side missions and odd jobs are well thought out.  The rewards from the side missions also make things easier down the road.  For example I got some quick hacks out of one side mission that made it hilarious to use on more powerful enemies.  Do it right and you can chain up some hacks that can level the playing field so you are not forced to simply farm lower level foes until you level up enough.\n\nI plan on replaying this game and I think it's worth the money.",

Technology etc.\n\nIt stays First Person and the enjoyable gunplay reminds me of Titanfall 2 Single Player Campaign.\n\nIt's different from Deus Ex: Human Revolution & Deus Ex: Mankind Divided. But it could be said Cyberpunk 2077 has achieved a slightly more immersive and broad realistic mega-metropolis. And the Nomad clans that litter the regional areas.\n\nI am privileged as I was able to play in VR with full RTX Raytraced graphics, everything set to highest.\nYou can play very good VR with less computing power if you switch the VR Mod for Cyberpunk (in its options box) to 'Z-Normal' rather than 'Direct 3D'. Won't have the extreme close 3d but it hardly matters for the increase in FPS.\n\nAnyway, it's Night City. Have fun and become a legend as you realize we're a simulation within a simulation :)\nSo enjoy \u2705",

Nothing is balanced and that is dope, you can really go about this game in many ways and become overpowered. I personally recommend being a spicy engineer. The small details with the world really bring it to life. My personal favorite fixture in the world is the role of insurance. Trauma team seems literally unbeatable and why wouldnt they be? Every insurance company is run by huge banks and collecting huge premiums for things that may never happen while they literally change the face of the market with the amount of money they are able to leverage. In a pure capitalist society, in which power can be measured by the tech in your body or the tech you surround yourself with, it only makes sense that insurance would be baddest dudes on the block. Dont mess with Trauma team.",

        "content": "Fun game, but it's still bugged as shit and full of either events breaking the laws of physics, or NPCs bugging the hell out of the world.\n\nI would give it a positive review for half the price. The current price is WAY TOO HIGH compared to what the game content is.\n\nI like the design, music, quests' stories as well as the attention to details in locations and the city. I don't like the fact that FPS jump like dancing cockroaches and the every 5th quest will randomly bug out if you do not follow the exactly same path as the beta-testing student they paid 5$/h for testing the game...\n\nGood game, but still bugged as hell, just WAY LESS than 2 years ago. I assume. Bought it on discount...\nI'm stuck with Delamain watching me like I was his doll and hijacking my phone calls.\n\nUpdate:\nI must add that this game has very mixed vibes. It feels as if the core team of the game tried creating a super cool game with a rich story, very professionally made cutscenes and in-game renders. It's really fascinating how complicated and rich the short moments of animations and animated scenes are. \n\nThere is also a ton of non-conventional player interactions, as well as a really vivid world that in fact feels a lot like real. This game really does a good job in presenting a futuristic city that feels alive. I never liked GTA games much, but this game has beaten GTA in many ways.\n\nIt hasn't beaten other games technically, but the design and creativity are supreme. I notice so many different and interesting patterns in the quests. The AIs, the movie/games references, the things like posters that you would pay a lot of money for in real life. It's really insane how many details you find. The paintings, the cars, the sound system. The voice-acting is on the top level. It's seriously the best voice acting I ever have seen.\n\nEverything is really high quality, but at the same time the buggy quests, bugging dialogues and flickering objects/NPCs can really destroy all of it. One of the biggest flaws is that the game is VERY short. You will finish the couple of quests in the main story line and that's it. There are many side quests but it's nowhere close to GTA or games like Skyrim or idk, even RTS games with campaigns like C&Q.\n\nI would really give this game a solid 8/10, but I personally hate the CEOs, who make a fucking game with the main protagonist fighting CORPS, but at the same time the said CEOs have been the same assholes to their very own employees. It's clearly visible in this game.\n\nThey forced many people to work overtime, they forced them to quit from mismanagement and stress. The talented people who made this game really special and amazing have left the studio because of them.\nThis is why this feels unfinished. This is why some game quests feel cut out of a bigger picture. Why does Jackie die so soon? Why is the main story so short, you find Takemura and you start working together after you just (indirectly) killed off his boss...\n\nThis is all present in the game, You see the great graphic design, great 3D models, great story and quests with interesting ideas. It's not a crap game from Ubisoft or EA. It's a game with super cool ideas, but unfinished and with technical issues.\n\nThe gameplay though is a whole new level, this is what gaming should be about.\nIt reminds me of the old quality games you played as child and could actually have fun with.\n\nI hate EA, hate Ubisoft, hate all the companies which have dragged down the modern games so much that they are mostly trash and money grinders against kids or some kind of vulnerable people.\n\nIn this game you can do all the things you usually can't do in any other games. You can interact with computers, the environment, hack, watch TV, read the journals, sneak or fight melee.\nIt's really unusual to find so many cool mechanics in an FPS game like this.\n\nThis game is actually a really good game, but it's a bit of a mess technically, mostly.\n\nI would fire the management team (especially for all their LIES and all their manipulation and they got paid so much for bullshitting people) and leave the programming/graphic designers/other crews. It really impresses me what they animated and how they merged all these elements so well.\n\nGTA is over-hyped, this is a game that is much more interesting and has had way fewer people working on it. The problem is that it's too short and isn't really bug-free.\n\nIn short words - it's underrated in terms of people who have performed a great work to make it. It doesn't deserve such criticism as a game. It deserves criticism against the management of the teams.",

Quests are sliiightly too short, combat is slightly too boring, and the environments are dope, but there are very few dungeons or actual levels to give you a challenge. HOWEVER! Edgerunners changes the game. Driving your car down a main highway, you start getting flashbacks to David and his mom. Knocking some Gonk out cold with your gorilla arms and you feel like Maine wondering \"this my fault?\". Drilling a Maelstrom a new eye hole  with your arm cannon, just like that homeless guy who zero'd.... well, you know. And most importantly, the Sandevistan slowing down time would be boring in any other game, but in Cyberpunk you feel like David Martinez showing the world that you're just built different. Everything everyone says about this game, is probably true. It's fun if you watch the show, and the glitches are obvious, but at least they're a good laugh.",

Skyrim blew my mind when it came, then Mass Effect 2 was why I bought the PS3.\nThen came Witcher 3 for which I bought PS4 and is the best game I played since. No wonder I was super excited to get my hands on Cyberpunk 2077 - but I read the reviews, and only had a slim PS4, so I passed.\nfast-forward 2 years later - I'm into anime these days I found Cyberpunk 2077 edge runners on Netflix, which is pretty damn awesome.\nI also have a decent Gaming PC these days (12-gen i7-12700K, RTX 2080ti, 144Hz monitor), which I rarely use, the game was on sale (50% off) most recent reviews were positive (nice feature, by the way, steam!), and I read the original reviews again which always said the game was terrific on PC even in day 1.\nThat's more than enough to convince me - so I bought it. I'm only 12 hours into the game but listen to met - it's freaking amazing. The visuals are the best I've ever seen, the storytelling is on a level of its own (though like every RPG it has its boring parts, just hit C to skip them), and the best thing (I hope I'm not jinxing myself, fingers crossed) - not a single bug! All runs smoothly (will check on those FPS soon), and the mechanics are great (driving could be improved though).\n\nI will update later on - but based on my experience so far its a 10/10 for me.",

I've run into the odd bug or visual glitch but the game is nowhere the the state it was on launch. Its clear CDPR is dedicated to improving and adding more content into the game, not to mention all of the mods released. Story is very good so far and the immersion levels are off the charts, gun play is solid but not top tier. There are alot of ways to play and builds to create which adds to the replayability. Don't go in expecting 10/10 but don't also believe alot of the hate from the past 2 years. Yeah the game was nearly unplayable and they lied about alot of shit but in the end who cares. They fucked up so move on, nearly every other game these days releases without some huge controversy or drama.  6 years ago no mans sky came out and was a laughing stock but hello games eventually redeemed themselves same thing applies to CDPR. The future looks bright for the game and whats already there is pretty good, so yeah play it. Even just for the world and story, which was good from the start. \n\nAlso Judy best girl.",

What was once an unplayable mess has blossomed into  a very solid game.  \n\nAnd while I have run into a quirk here and there, its nothing game breaking, and nothing we haven't run into other massive open world games.  \n\nFrom the story, the graphics, and the game play there is a lot to enjoy here.

        "content": "My absolute favourite game. I bought it at launch then waited a couple months for updates before playing. Best part of this game is definetly is it's world. Gorgeous, vibrant and full of character. The map rewards you for adventuring as lots of content can be found by just being curious and deciding to go off the usual trail. The main mission, while I wish it were longer, is an emotional roller-coaster of hope and desperation. Every character has so much personality, you become attached to many of them. Combat such as quick hacking makes fighting feel very unique. Even after you finish the game, there's lots of other cyberpunk content to chew on such as official comics, plenty of great mods and of course the incredible edgerunners anime. Character customisation is a bit limited, can't add much cyberwear to your character and you can only choose from presets instead of sliders, however that's a rather small nitpick as I really appreaciate a game with lots of customisation. And where Cyberpunk lacks in it's character customisation, it makes up for in its clothing options. Loads of interesting clothes and accessories to discover and cycle through. All in all, I've recommended this game to many people, even before it's sudden explosion in popularity, and I will continue to do so as I believe in the team behind this franchise and I am very excited to see how Phantom Liberty will turn out.",

        "content": "I'd say this game came along way from it's launch. I'm glade they didn't pull an EA or other gaming company tactic of instantly abandoning the game. It's not perfect, but it's in a really good place overall.\n\nPro's: \n- The game is absolutely beautiful if you have a rig that can run it on the highest graphics, My 3090TI actually warms up pretty badly when playing this with everything basically on Ultra but it's stunning.\n- The game play is mostly fleshed out and there are few bugs that interfere with your play through.\n- Bug's in general are mostly gone, I've had a few weird moments but everything is running like it's supposed too.\n- The stuff they added from edgerunners is slightly heart wrenching but I love that they added it all in 2 years after the game launched. It shows the Devs from CDPR still care about this game at least some, although they cut alot of the content they were going to release, which sucks, they haven't gone full abandonment on it.\n- The game is overall fun to play and mess around in, it feels a lot more alive than when it launched.\n\nCons: \n-I'm not sure how the game looks or runs in low quality graphics, but this game is really, REALLY, graphically intense if you want it to look the best.\n- If you watched edgerunners, there are a lot of references and songs that will remind you of that story and possibly make you sad as fuck.\n- There isn't as much choice as most people would want from an RPG. You have usually three or two options in every major decision, sort of like mass effects paragon system, not as bad, but it's usually go nuts on everyone, act like someone who cares/or like a baby and whine. When the third option is around, its usually considered the \"rebel's\" path but it's only available in a few situations. The same is about who you align with but thats more towards the end. You can get choose to have your friends help, choose to have the corps help, or go full rebel and solo it. It's not the worst, but it's also not the best in terms of options.\n\nOverall, the game is pretty fleshed out right now, and really enjoyable. Most people came back because of edgerunners and start going full PTSD when specific songs play or you go to specific areas. I hope CDPR keeps it up and learns from their mistakes. Also, I hope they paying for Anime about edgerunners, or that the company that made the anime keeps doing cyberpunk like anime. I'd say now's a good time if you don't have it to try it out. Hopefully they do another cyberpunk but without the launch they did for this one.",

Dialogs haven't really had an important weight, some of them are even useless, a waste of time, one way only, even the background of V doesn't matter in the end since it only change the Prologue but you end up the same way, as a mercenary (but there are severals endings). Still a solid game with lots of fun if you like stuff like Borderlands and Fallout.",

(you know its basic, I don't even need to explain this one.)\n\nHow about having interactable amenities/attractions so the player feels like a character and not like a spectator?\n\nHow about making your character's life path longer than 3 scenes and actually impact the story?\n\n\n\nSo many small things can be done to make this game good but devs would rather spend their time making more linear story missions in the form of DLC.\n\nYou had the chance to set a new standard for gaming but instead got wrapped up in crunch-culture due to horrible direction. Good on yas!\n\n\n\nBunch of corpo g0nks!\n\n\n",

My PC has an integrated graphic card and it runs OK... imagine that.\n\nThe dialogues are kinda childish, but the overall plot is great. It grants you much freedom. If you enjoy a story about living to fight another day, becoming a legend regardless of the outcomes, you will enjoy it. There are many different endings, and each of them have very different results.\n\nGameplay? Incredible. Kill. Kill. Steal. Hack. Talk. Explore. The city is HUGE with an incredible amount of things to do. Most of them are a bit repetitive, you just have to kill or steal. Sincerely, I prefer that than too many different missions. The main missions grant you enough variety of missions, if I don't have time to spend 1 hour in intricate missions I prefer just to click on the map, go there, kill, loot. The design of the city is amazing, the details, the different locations... gorgeous.\n\nYou can customize your character to the max. The appearance, the clothes, the weapons, many different abilities (hacking, mele, shooting...).\n\nJust buy it and play it. Now.\n\nPS: Don't watch the anime. It's gay.",

Imagine borderlands guns, but look less interesting, and the elemental effects dont matter.\n* clothing is basic - mods arn't very interesting / have minimal effect\n* pretty much all player skills can be ignored, they are all garbage\n* whole world can feel a bit samey\n* cars are shit / handling is poopoo\n\nBiggest negative\n* 75% of the game you're busy looking at the hud, not what's going on in front of you. - c'mon this is cyberpunk, could they not have made the hud part of what you see - a minimap in the top right, what is this, 2010?",

        "content": "This game is not without its flaws. It had many upon release. Most have been cleaned up in post-release patches but there're still a few. The world that CDPR has created here, though, has plenty of potential. Really interesting take on the semi-dystopian future of technology and massive corporations stomping on regular people.\n\nKeanu Reeves gives a great performance as Johnny. Most of the other performances for most of the other characters are quite good too. The story is a bit of a downer, but still interesting & compelling. The gameplay is solid. Gunplay, hacking, stealth, melee weapons all feel different yet still viable.\n\nSome of the design choices are a bit odd. The driving mechanics are subpar at best. There are some mods that can provide some QoL enhancements but it's a bit rough around the edges. If you're interested but still lukewarm on the game, wait for a sale. I still think it's worth a play for most people. I am looking forward to seeing if CDPR can flesh this world out a bit more with the next installment(s).",

        "content": "There are literally hundreds of thousands of reviews so my posting of this is like taking a leak into the atlantic and expecting it to raise the sea level, so i'll try to keep it brief for the few who may see this. I'll break it into 4 parts: the great, the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\n-The Great: The story & lore are so in depth it'll take 100 hours just to read all of the shards you find. It absolutely engulfed me into the game right off the bat. The combat is smooth like a red hot knife through the skulls of my enemies, and there are numerous builds to choose from. My first run was a full-on assault character using a sniper rifle and a revolver. Second run is a stealth build with a revolver and throwing knives. The perk trees are almost overwhelming in my opinion, it feels like almost too much to keep track of.\n\n-The Good: Load times, for the most part. I usually don't wait a crazy long time for the game to load from the start menu but after that you rarely get load screens. The optimization is good too, my pc isn't crazy beefy but I didn't have to make it 480p quality in order to run it well, so it still looks good and usually runs at ~70-90 in areas that aren't packed with npcs\n\n-The Bad: Glitches aren't nearly as rampant as they once were, and the ones I ran into were (mostly) not game breaking. Initially it was just t-posing characters and stuff having trouble loading in, and then there were a few game-breaking ones like getting soft locked out of completing a minor side quest, also locking me out of getting an achievement. If you somehow see this before playing the game, QUICKSAVE BEFORE EVERY SINGLE NCPD ENCOUNTER. I had like 3 on my first run say i needed to grab the item to complete it despite already grabbing it, and so i got locked out of completion. Crashing wasn't really a big deal on my first playthrough. Got to like 75 hours and it only crashed 3 times, but now i'm on my second playthrough like 10 hours in and it has already crashed like 6 times, so i guess it's not THAT bad but it's not a good thing either.\n\n-The Ugly: Other than being soft locked out of 100%ing the game, there isn't really much that is really THIS bad. The only thing that really upset me while playing was the feeling like I was lost during most of it. Not like... in a literal sense, there's just so much fucking stuff to this game that you need to learn so I found myself looking up guides on skill trees and that god forsaken hacking minigame. Don't get me wrong, I eventually got the hang of it but the game gives you one quick tutorial while rapid firing all sorts of other info at you. I still don't exactly know what \"daemons\" are and I'm around 100 hours.\n\nTL;DR: Good game, not as buggy as it once was, save before every single ncpd mini mission if you want to 100% it. Definitely recommend, especially if you are a Destiny veteran and enjoy the leveling system that Destiny had.",

I had no intention of getting it when it was 60, bought it half off this weekend, but I see why people would have been excited about it.\n\nThis studio is very good at story-driven gameplay. Proved it with Witcher and did it again here. Very similar next gen facial expressions where once again, every now and then in dialog the characters will emote and you will read it clearly(sometimes off timed with the automatic movement, the shuffling, which can make it a little confusing), but when it turns out right, you really will read their expressions. To a point where it's something worth paying attention to!\n\nI'm not a big fan of the level-aspect method, especially in gun play. Where it's impossible to kill a 'higher ranked' character essentially. Despite this, the game is very good.\n\nI did have a weird 'corrupted download' message, but if you run into this my solution was to close steam and restart, then voila, it was okay.\n\nAnother issue(I'm PC, mouse and keyboard) was the auto center while driving. Check out a nexus mod called Disable Vehicle Auto Center. You can 'remove' this issue with a simple .exe you can download there that allows you to use middle mouse to turn it on and off. The mod moves your cursor a little every half second, preventing auto center and is unnoticeable while driving. You'll get used to switching it off and on, especially once you're sick of auto center.\n\nOverall, really cool game. A bit evil though, on the esoteric, transhumanism, lots of occultic symbolism if you know what you're looking at. Wish they could have stayed away from the 'brave new world' and just made a sci fi story. If you're with God though, none of that crap is worth a damn though.",

Combat can be a little wonky at times, but for the most part it feels pretty good, and is easy to get used to. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games like GTA V, RDR2, and the Fallout series. I believe if the game was released back in 2020, as it is today, it would have easily won game of the year.

I enjoy walking in Kabuki and Japantown, for me it is the ultimate cyberpunk experience.

The Balance may be a little bit off at times allowing you to exploit the weirdest mechanics, but good is a sandbox with no exploits? Overall, definitely recommend this game to more people!",

So this review is an objective look at the current game without all the previous drama. \n\nThis game is a 10/10. Every single side quest feels like it has meaning. The story telling is phenomenal. Visually speaking I can't believe how large and detailed Night City is in this game. I have never, ever, played a story game a second time immediately after beating it the first time, and I did for this game. My first playthrough I went Katana/Sandevistan and on my second I went full netrunner. I'm constantly finding things I didn't see the first playthrough and it's been such an enjoyment. There's always going to be small things to nitpick, but as a whole, this game is a 10/10 in my book and the small issues I have don't take away from that. \n\nAt first I was annoyed by the fact you can't fast travel from anywhere, but then I realized this is the only game I actually don't mind riding around in to my destination, especially because it might introduce you to something new en route.",

The Writing, The Main story, the Unique Side Quest missions, the Delamain quests, that talking Smart Pistol named Skippy, Keanu Reeves, Voice acting (Just as Jackie Wells simply dying almost made me tear up). The Night City (The details and the architect of the city is superb, beautiful, and believably alive and what should other open-world games should do)\nSteam Deck optimized. \nYou can change Wardrobe without having to change the current stats for your Armor stats. But it's almost pointless because the game is always at First Person View. Aside from driving on motorcycle and viewing your character through mirror.\n\nAs for Bugs and Glitches, almost non-existent in the 1.6 Version:\n*Aside from the Tutorial/Training mission where the Combat Bot T-posed when I attacked it. \n*That one scripted sequence where Panam follows me to tail the Wraiths to save Saul. The Panam zooms with speed when near reaching the destination. Wtf lmao.\n*NPCs' animation when driving doesn't move the steering wheel when turning.\n*When talking to Mr. Peralez along with Mrs. Peralez during that side mission, the audio glitched and no audio when he talks.\n\nNEGATIVES:\nI hated it when it tried to be Borderlands. Make constant micromanagements to Weapons and Wardrobe stats. Get the same-looking and same-sounding Weapon and Wardrobe (Armor) for the 5th time because it had higher DPS and Damage and had better Stats and more slots for attachments and mods. It took me 50 hours to find out that there's an Upgrade section within Crafting so it makes more sense to keep weapons longer.\n\nSTEAM DECK:\nBought STEAM DECK just for this game and it runs amazingly well for a portable PC because I don't have a gaming PC and my APU laptop runs like crap even on lowest settings. No crashes. Used my own settings for sharper quality image and for photo mode. 800p native Steam Deck screen resolution (AMD FSR Off), Medium Settings, Low Shadow Distance, High Texture and Crowd Density. Yes. There were frame drops of course down to 20-28fps when it involves rain and large crowd in Heywood, The Glen and in most vegetative areas in North Oak. Driving fast is a no issue at all. Obviously when driving to a crowded part of the city that is. \n\nOverall Score: 9.1/10",

I ended up putting it down before completing it - I didn't want to finish the game with all of the bugs because I felt it wouldn't do it justice (and I didn't trust that the end-game experience would be satisfying with the state it was in). Now, through a series of updates and free content, I decided to re-download the game and start the game with a fresh character. Needless to say, the game is 10x more playable and I have thoroughly enjoyed getting caught back up in the world CDPR created. If you like their previous projects but held off because of the mess at launch, I think it's safe to say that there's no better time to give this game a shot. There's plenty to do - side quests, random encounters, gigs for different \"fixers\" in different parts of the city, and a deep main quest line. Highly recommend!",

I would recommend this game others\n\n                                      When the game came out in 2020, there were a lot of issues that was commonly spotted by streamers and other players alike that seemed to be too big of an issue to deal with if I bought the game at that time. Bugs like NPCs would ragdoll on the ground while talking in the middle of a mission, cars getting stuck under the asphalt/concrete road, side missions would not continue with the dialogue in order to finish it, etc. For quite a lot of people the game was unplayable.\n                      But since then the game has been given improvements over time and has reached a new audience in 2022 with their show on Netflix; Cyberpunk Edgerunners. I highly recommend the show to many others, considering the game aside, because of how genuinely good the show it is with its variety of its cast members and how memorable they are. One of my personal favorites being David and Maine who at one point come across the same issue in the story which i will not spoil. With the release of the anime, CD Projekt Red also came out with its new update 1.16 that has major updates such as fixing the phone issue were it could constantly ring and couldnt reject the call, cars are more accessible, new weapons added, and so forth.\nOf course not all games are perfect and Cyberpunk does have some small bugs like the cars being stock underground but rarely happens on occasion or the models would t-pose once or twice the entire playthrough.\n                                           Frankly I really do recommend this amazing game that ive invested way too many hours in lately and I couldnt complain about the game. One ofsuggestion from the developing team is giving us the option to change the zoom settings on the map so we can see more of the map itself so we dont pass our exits when driving. Overall I love the game and im sure more people would too.\n",

But like many others it obliterated me into a million pieces like the weakling i was back then. \n\nNow I've ascended into Choom hood and went from 30 hours on the game to 121 hours in a few weeks of non stop gaming and crying. The game went from a mostly negative to a mostly positive with 10 episodes studio trigger is a different breed. only reason it isn't more hours is cause my power supply decided i needed to return to my actual life so it sacrificed itself like johnny did for me.....rest in peace.\n\nI've finished my street kid walkthrough and started my corpo walkthrough. It's just too fun now the game is functional. Been to all the places shown in edgerunners so i can cry my eyes out. All i can say is this game is nova so get it or regret it.\n\nalmost forgot Rebecca best girl can't change my mind sorry",

Nice.\n\nPlaying as a stealth-game, it feels a bit like Deus Ex (the two last ones) and I like it. The story is somewhat engaging, as is the world, but not on the level it got hyped up to. Still reasonable. I would say play unless you have something better and buy at sale. \n\nDo _not_ buy this for the car driving. At least with keyboard+mouse the steering is the most horrible mess I ever experienced. You do not need to use cars a lot though. ",

There's still some major things that need to repaired. but it is now a bit more focused so now i know what  i must do in the game.

        "content": "Yes, there are still occasional glitches and weird collision issues. But there is also a really solid game and it is amazing.\nThe gameplay is varied. Has your classic warrior/rouge/wizard type builds or play a hybrid. Stealth is very important for a few parts (especially for bonus rewards) you can face enemies in a number of interesting ways.\nThere are generally multiple ways of reaching your goals, depending on your build, adding to replayability and the temptation to explore and see what else is possible.\nIt feels like being in a real city, with distinct neighborhoods and districts. Give Night City a reskin and it could be a modern city.\nCharacters have believable goals and motivations. Do what they want and they'll help you out. Get in their way and they'll (try to) take you out. There aren't orcs/raiders/etc just looking to chase you down.\nI care about these people and want good things for them, even when I know it's not always a possibility.\nThe story, in spite of a few flaws, grabs me and has interesting and rational twists and turns. The side stories are interesting and fill out the world nicely.\nThe endings are a gut punch. Try them all out and see the different ways things can go. Heck, the game wants you to.\nSo yes, I really love this game. I started playing at version 1.5, having avoided even buying it until I felt sure it would be properly updated. It's been a heck of a journey but I really like where it's ended up.",

        "content": "Tentative recommendation. I bought the game on sale for 50% off, and my first playthrough lasted 88 hours. That should say something. It has major issues which took me out of the experience.\n\nSkill trees:\n\nThe highlights are the skill system. I was genuinely stumped. Most RPGs usually shoehorn you into a set of skills which are readily apparent and meant to work together to make a certain build. With Cyberpunk, you get enough skill points to max out 2 trees or get really good in 3 different trees. It allows a lot of hybrid classes. I played a stealth hacker who would rampage with a shotgun when thins went south.\n\nStory:\n\nThe main story and the major character sidequests are quite compelling. I found those plotlines very well executed. The VA was amazing, and the NPCs oozed style and character.  They were very memorable and really made the world feel alive. The fixer sidequests - not so much. They were generic - here's a rando, go kill him. Go there, steal something without setting off the alarms. You finished all my missions, here's a legendary weapon. They were pretty boring at face value, but the actual level design was amazing. Even inconsequential missions had multiple ways to approach them.\n\nWorld design:\n\nNight city is the best in-game city ever made. It is gorgeously designed and instils an amazing sense of scale. The aesthetic is awesome. It blends high tech futurism with the dilapidated refuse of anarcho capitalism. There's literally a massive garbage pile spanning several in-game square miles. It's amazing. However, this is let down by the NPCs. They are super dumb copy-pasted mobs. They all say the same thing. There are places where NPCs are permanently stationed which gets really old really quick. It's really bad.\n\nLoot:\n\nLoot's super boring. You get new stuff thrown at you constantly. It's all boring blue and purple upgrades which you use for 2 missions then replace. The tech skill is pretty much mandatory if you want to keep any emotional connection to your inventory. You can't upgrade iconic items to the next rarity tier without certain skills in the Tech tree. Even then, it feels like a waste of time. You have to go around vendors to buy item components. This allows you to upgrade your iconic weapons until they are barely better than the blue and purple trash items that the game showers you with.\n\nBugs:\n\nHere's where the game really lets itself down. It CDPR's credit, I only had one or two crashes in my 88 hours of gameplay. However, the game is nowhere near bug-free. It is absolutely riddled, head-to-toe, in visual and graphical glitches and bugs. Here's a very short list:\n\n- Scripted NPC driving sequences - Car jumps around when you get in, and the NPC initiates the sequence.\n\n- Changing your appearance with an outfit applied causes your character's \"special bits\" to clip through the clothing.\n\n- Character randomly exits stealth when walking back from cover.\n\n- Hiding a body causes a loot container to float in mid-air\n\n- Bodies fail to ragdoll properly if the NPC dies on top of a physics object (like the thousands of trash bags you find everywhere). It causes the body to just float in mid-air.\n\n- Infinite scrolling bug when disassembling weapons. If you scroll down and disassemble an item, it causes the UI to scroll to the top then try to scroll back to where you were. Then that repeats around 5-10 times per second. It's horrible\n\n- Calling a fast vehicle often causes it to skid to a halt around 100 meters away from you, making you run after it to chase it down.\n\nThat's just a very VERY small number of the bugs I encountered. There were many more, and they aren't random things which happen maybe once every 5-10 hours. I was experiencing any number of bugs every 10 or so minutes. It's still a very broken game, even on PC.\n\nStill, I give it a tentative recommendation because the good barely squeaked by to outnumber the bad.",

        "content": "It's been a while since the game first came out, and many people online have said how much better the game plays, so I decided to check it out. \n\nThe game is definitely flawed, as there are a ton of noticeable glitches that take away from the game. There have been multiple times in which I would feel so immersed in the world but then suddenly something would happen that would completely break that immersion. This would include horrible cutscene animations while in cars or NPCs randomly glitching out. Also should be fair to mention how janky (think that's how you spell it) the driving is. Doesn't feel very smooth but at least it gets the job done.\n\nBut there is mostly where my gripes end. Ignoring the bugs that seem to plague the game, even after all the updates this game has been given, the experience is quite good. The game tries its best to immerse you in the corrupt and horrible world of Cyberpunk. There are a ton of quests that really stick to you and set the theme of the game. It doesn't shy away from showing the true horrors of the world. \n\nThe gunplay is also fairly fun and interesting. I haven't delved far enough to say much about it, but so far it's been good. There seem to be a lot of upgrades that can definitely change the combat experience depending on what you prefer. I look forward to experimenting. \n\nOverall, it's a good game with flaws. If you're willing to overlook the negative things about this game, I believe you might have a positive experience with the game. If you're looking for something more polished, maybe look elsewhere.",

Definatly my new favorite RPG Sandbox. Happy to hear they will be doing more in the future. Cant wait!!",

I know both are cautionary tales of what the future may hold for humanity but getting to explore it for yourself in 2077 and seeing how others navigate it and are  affected by it in edgerunners is an amazing experience. I think they have made me feel a sense of longing, a longing to be something more, to try and make sense of my life and to live a life that no matter when I go, I'm happy with what I've accomplished and who I have around me.\n\nTL;DR: Watch the anime, play the game, it may spark something inside of you :)\n\nAlso its been great to see CDPR stick with this game and get it to where it is today, a very enjoyable experience compared to when it first came out.",

Besides playing the missions themselves - which I also enjoy, I absolutely enjoy just taking my time just walking/driving/riding around Night City, in all its Bladerunner/Bubblegum Crisis vibe in full glory (soaking it in)... almost so realistic, it makes me wonder \"What if this was really our world today?\".  I dig it -- can't keep away - reentering the game time-to-time to play.  Recommended, enjoyable and man please give us more than one upcoming DLC (maybe even MP)!!!\n(the mods that CDPR supports from everyday players are a blast as well!)",

You can completely overhaul how the game plays to tailor to YOUR liking.  \n\nPro Tip: Complete all gigs in Watson in vanilla.  Whatever you don't like about the game, find a mod for a fix.  \n\nDon't like how the vehicles handle?  There are mods for that.  \n\nDon't like the bullet spongy enemies early game?  There are mods for that. \n\nDon't like being invincible late game?  There are mods for that. \n\nWant a customizable or more immersive HUD?  Want more crafting freedom?  Want to change appearance of NPCs?  Want more radio stations?  Yeah, there are mods for that. \n\nAre you annoyed by the cinematics when you're first launching the game or whenever you're loading a save?  Are you tired of the never-ending buzzing when you're in a menu?  Good god, why aren't there mute options in the vanilla!?!?  Well, thankfully, there are mods for that.",

        "content": "I waited a long time to pick this up. We can't ignore the elephant in the room so lets get to it.\n\nThe game had a god awful launch, barely playable. I was just sitting in the sidelines watching it all unfold. Seeing patch after patch be released I waited 2 years before picking it up.\n\nI'm glad I did. Lets go over some obvious points:\n\nGraphics.\nCurrent gen is amazing, and I'm so excited to see what will be possible in the future, roughly 3 months before buying this game I built a new system. My old 2012 hardware just wasn't cutting it anymore. Handles the game well. With an RTX 3070 and Ryzen 5 5600x the game runs smooth at a capped 60FPS on a mix of high and ultra settings. (Temps for those who care, CPU at 50-62C with AIO cooler, and the GPU ran at an average of 61-67C with the stock cooler) The visuals in this game are just impressive to say the least. Can't go wrong with how the game looks.\n\nStory:\nI didn't have a lot of expectations for it, and I also avoided all spoilers and really anything with the story. I was pleasantly surprised! Is it a perfect story? No of course not. Is it cheesy and stupid? I would say no. Its well written, has a good pace. And the options you can take during it are really fun. Character building is this stories strong suit, you can really get invested in this game. Since its an RPG game, the replay value is there in types of builds as well as different endings. Solid story all around.\n\nGameplay: \nGunplay is pretty standard, feels smooth and a lot of the weapons have a satisfying punch, melee is also fun! The hacking in the game isn't what I would call rocket science, and most of the time I ended up just blasting through enemies becuz fast = gud. \n\nBugs I encountered:\nBoss fights with enemies that can punch or launch you, I got sent through a wall and into a void every once in a great while. Its annoying but I just had to reload a save.\n\nPhysics can still be a little wonky in vehicles. \n\nNPC clipping, can be funny but can really take you out of a scene if its something serious going on.\n\nOverall, I'd say I can recommend this game if your PC can handle it, its come a long way since launch.",

        "content": "At first the game was a messier than a porn orgy. I started on Ps4 and after it committed suicide, I bought a PC, bought this game for 30 bucks on sale, and honestly, it's better than before, still a little buggy but haven't experienced like the major ones in the past. On PC it runs so much smoother, graphics for me are pretty, and Redmod made it even better. Yea adding mods to the game when those type of mechanics and details should of been in the game originally is a huge kick in the nuts but whats positive is that those mods are more likely to be better than if they were actually supposed to be implemented. The use of mods makes it way better, detailed, and little immersed. If you're thinking of buying it then do it. But honestly wait for a sale, or just buy it now, look at guides or comments on how to activate redmod which isnt hard, go to nexus, get vortex and bam... have fun.",

Riddle me that Batman. However, the main Narrative, and some of the Side Quests have had me laughing, crying, screaming, yelling, slamming controllers, and looking into endless guides on how to GIT GUUD.

I still encounter some major bugs even at this newest 1.6 edgerunner update yes. But I would say at least it's super fun to play. You can literally hangout in nightcity all day without feeling boring.\n\nA word of advice who're new to this game: [spoiler] Sometimes your action actually have major consequences in game. It's fun to kill no doubt but sometimes once they're gone they're gone forever. Save your game often so certain things will still be accessible to you till the end game [/spoiler]",

I haven't experienced any real bugs, just some kinks so trust me and buy this game!\n\nTo the people who made this game possible, thank you. \n\nSincerely,\nRydog",

Only one time in my 104 hour playthrough did I run into a bug that was frustrating, and I just had to reload to get rid of it. \n\nAmazing game, amazing story, and your choices actually feel like they matter, which can only be said for so many games. Buy it on sale or full price, both are worth it (i spent 100+ hours on my first playthrough alone, and plan to do a few more so I can get all the different possible endings). \n\nThe biggest complaint is the police system. The police don't have cars. There's no actual vehicle related combat or chases. They clearly planned to add this, but never did. They have an entire 4-mission questline involving death races, where you race and shoot at eachother. Except nobody shoots at eachother, despite them constantly yelling things like \"keep shooting!\".",

        "content": "Its good now? Always has been.\n\nThat phrase is a lie, however, Cyberpunk 2077, from a technical standpoint, is still not perfect but has managed to become the game that it probably should have been at launch. Frame rate performance is what it should be, usually well over 60fps for my PC as opposed to 25FPS when the game first launched. There are still the occasional bugs, but most of them are the hilarious bugs that we have grown accustom to in this type of open world RPG. Nothing as game breaking as when I had first played the game in 2020 and the quests would not start or every NPC T-posing in the street. \n\nOn my current and technically my first playthrough (bugs made me quit my first one after only a few hours), what has really hooked me is the game's story and setting. Previous to CP2077, the only CDPR game I had played was The Witcher 3. That game had a great main story with interesting characters that I found myself caring about and a world that was very detailed. While I have not finished CP2077 's main story line yet, I have already fallen in love with the game's world and characters. \n\nIf you can allow yourself to approach this game for what it is, an RPG game with rich characters and a tragic world, and not as the next GTA, this game is highly enjoyable and immersive. I highly recommend Cyberpunk 2077 in its current state and I am excited about the future of this game and franchise.",

Honestly I stopped playing Cyberpunk for a good few months.\n\nRecently I started playing again because of a lot of updates and wow, game is playable, ofc there is still stuff to be fixed but game is finally playable. Don't get me wrong there are some stuff in this game that i wish were fixed or done differently, i expected this game to be many many things, for me it was 50% - 50% .\n\nOverall I loved the game, graphics, game play, story, characters . But still kinda sucks we got such a bit time with Jackie.\n\nI would totally recommend this game to anyone that wants to play it and get lost in the Night City.\n\nAlso, for now , I am waiting for the new DLC that is about to come out and also, for the new Cyberpunk game that will be out in a couple of years, who know, maybe 2030 ? That would be good.  I bet the new Cyberpunk game will , and hopefully fully deliver to us, exactly what the devs dreamed, leaving behind what happened to the release of the first Cyberpunk. \n\nIt was a great game, thank you CDPR , see ya in the new DLC and in a few years, Cyberpunk 2 :D \n\n",

Now that we're done with the \"tOxiC\" formalities, 2 yrs later this game is still bad. I'm still experiencing bugs. The only reason I paid $60 for this game is because of their anime but now I understand that the game is still poopy. Save your money, this game isn't isn't worth it.",

Player agency is at a minimum and dialogue choices largely boil down to how much of a passive-aggressive a-hole you want to be with the only major choice being how you tackle the final mission. RPG elements are surface level and most choices, like the PC's background, are meaningless. Combat is a mixed bag constantly hampered by janky ai. Night City offers little for the player to interact with outside of equipment shops, mission locations and a few other points of interest. Despite improvements since launch Cyberpunk 2077 still remains a bug-ridden shell of the game CDPR promised.",

I very rarely encountered a bug and the only serious one was self induced by changing the general path of a mission with a shortcut and was eventually able to get past it. The games graphics are great it's story is compelling and interesting it has between the main, gig and side jobs over 200+ missions to do along 3 life paths and 6 possible endings with 4 difficulty settings.  Guaranteeing enough variability that you will very likely place this all the way through again. It also offers something unique in that if you choose during which ever ending you go down with the dialogue option that returns the character back the the story saved before you chose to finish up the last main mission which turns off access to side jobs and gigs giving you the ability  to go back and hit up the side jobs and gigs you did not play before while doing the main arc.  Further more they just released a trailer for a coming expansion next year. I finished my first play through in just over 70 hours on the lowest difficulty which only brought me to level 28 so not maxed out attributes and perks. Going to finish up all the secondary stuff before I consider replaying it again.",

The story is great and it's cool how you can role play V differently for every new game, not just in whether they're a nomad or a corp or a street kid, but how \"good\" or \"evil\" they are, the amount of dialogue in this game is INSANE. I've played and finished this game 17 times. I haven't yet played a more evil V, and I know there's a ton of interactions I haven't had yet. EVERY NEW GAME I FOUND SOMETHING NEW. Every new playthrough. Things like waiting a moment longer than you did last playthrough and a character might stop in a doorway and you experience something new that way, or walking up to a character that you didnt before in a situation and surprise they have something to say or V has something to say. I've walked around the city A LOT and still theres little pockets of things new to discover every playthrough. I watched a youtube video the other day of something you can find in the badlands that i've never found! After 17 playthroughs! The immersion! The Cyberpunk. This game just RULES ok? ok.",

I do highly recommend getting a mod that removes the main quest cause the whole 'johnny' character arc is honestly the least interesting thing about this game and that includes people watching randos eating pizza out of a cup. When the main quest segments pop up I mute the games audio and alt tab and every few minutes pop back and select literally any option to just get me the fuck out of the crappy plot that makes soap operas seem high quality and well written.\n\nAll jokes aside, games solid, fun to play, the main quest is honestly a little triggering if you don't like the game taking over your character and forcing you into like 30+ minute existential conversations that in the literal sense you could just walk away from but they won't let you because their writers ...got lazy? underpaid? No idea but the main quest sucks, fair warning. There are people who like it, this review is for folks coming in and don't like that stuff, those who do come on in the waters fine. For those who don't, look up if the mod exists yet when you read this, otherwise play until you finish the tutorial stuff + Jackie and then just don't ever progress the main quest and the game will be so much more fun for you. Seriously I'm just going to be restarting having slogged through the main quest only to find that it sucked as much at the end as it does at the beginning.\n\n***Edit***\n\nHaving replayed the game after making a new character, it's just as bad or even worse the second time around, there's just so much \"Game time\" you spend watching a cutscene some dev made of another person playing the game you paid for. You then will frequently be given the great joy of playing johnny fucking sliverdick the omega douche alpha chimp for SIGNIFICANTLY longer than is fun and then keep playing as him for a while longer. There's going to be points in the game where for plot reasons you spend extended periods just hacking and coughing like you've caught covid once again in a 24 hour in game period and are going to go through the entire process for the next few minutes.\n\nOverall I can barely give this game a positive rating, cause there are extended periods where you can fully ignore the main plot and the objectively shitty design therein, but if you couldn't ignore it (and it really tries to force it on you, every time you finish a quest it redirects you back into the main quest like a drug dealer trying to force the issue at fucking gun point) it's gonna be an honestly shitty experience unless you like watching a less interesting extended edition lotr marathon as done by keanu reeves who I love as an actor but honestly shouldn't have touched this in any way...",

Well almost 2 years after I started it and I'm so glad I finally did it. The game still has performance issues even with decent hardware, but that's not a problem when the story left me speechless. I loved everything about Cyberpunk as a fan of story driven open world games this is one of my favorites. The characters, the world building even tho it seems some of it was cut unfortunately in the final product, the emotions that hit after meeting and talking with everyone really left an impression on me. Its a shame that the game was so unready at the launch, but I believe it did achieve something special in the end and I'm really happy to finally give this game a chance. Definitely recommend for everyone to give this game a try at least once. CDPR you fucked up, but you did it.",

That mostly kept me away from the game. Now that some time has past, and CD Project has batched most of the glitches and done some quality of life improvements, I was courage enough to try the game out and i am not disappointed. World feels lived, characters that you get to know are well written and interesting and it feels like your choices actually matter. Of course there are still a lots of minor and some major bugs but i haven't encountered any game breaking/crashing bugs, mostly some illusion breaking like NPCs do some goofy stuff or walking animation does not render gun properly. Gameplay it shelf ain't nothing new about, basic RPG elements mixed with first person shooting and melee combat. Also dodge feels little stiff on keyboard and mouse, i dont know about on controller. But still i have had blast playing the game. I am currently at the close to end of the game and doing some side quest to people of Night city. I hope that you have at least much as fun than i do. \n\n8/10 Solid game to play if computer can handle it.",

(All of the gigs are the same, either drive some place, or clear an area and hit F on something)\n\nThe driving is worse than the old Saint's Row games, its like your car doesn't move fast enough compared to how fast you are actually going. 150MPH feels like 45MPH, and the brakes on all the cars are absolutely abysmal. \n\nSoundtrack is complete garbo. Even for someone who loves synthwave, and outrun as music genres. Instead of actual decent music its all obnoxiously loud rap and death metal. I unironically don't like a single song in the whole game. I don't know why there isn't a channel for true synth music and not some wanna be punk trash. It would be fine if not every rap song was trying to sing Rap God at 10x speed, or had earrape instrumentals.\n\nTurrets do way too much damage comparative to other enemies. I swear, turrets were the only enemies that posed a threat. Even enemies with tons of cyberware never did any interesting moves besides the occasional dash forwards at you. \n\nWhat's the point in choosing genitals when there are zero graphic sex scenes in the game, and your character is always wearing their undies? You'll show tits left and right but not dicks and vaginas? \n\nMy game would have a stroke for like 5 seconds every time I exited out of the inventory screen before shortly returning to normal. (framerate would become slideshow levels of bad, otherwise it was smooth)\n\nThe melee finisher animations take you out of slow mo from the cyberware ability, then give you a full cooldown on it, screwing you over. (I did a slow mo ninja melee build, this shit pissed me off and got me killed so many times)\n\nThe braindance scenes were boring rather than interesting to me, and I think it's time developers come to a realization that sections in video games that you're required to search around with a camera and scan shit, are a fad and nobody likes them. Its the modern day on-rails turret section.\n\nYou are unable to complete some of the side gigs if you do not spec lots of attribute points into the technical tree. In a game where you can't max everything out so if you don't wanna specialize in that, fuck you, you can't 100% the game. Take some examples from Fallout New Vegas, regardless of what you specialize in, there is a method to complete your objective. You may get less reward depending on what it is, but there's still a way to complete it. I shouldn't have to spec 15/20 points into technical to open a fucking door with no other way in for a side quest. ESPECIALLY if you can't max everything out. \n\nDialogue was extremely lacking, character kept trying to act like a kool kid the whole time, and none of the dialogue actually makes any difference besides Fingers.\n\nAlso fuck you devs for making Fingers the only ripperdoc to sell some of the best exclusive cyberware. Yet he is introduced as a pervert who works on prostitutes and has  multiple dialogue options implying that he sells faulty hardware, shortly followed by the option to punch him twice, somehow killing him in the process. That felt like a purposeful troll and made me have to go back 5+ hours of gameplay to go not kill him so i could get the good sandevistan that only he sells. Learn to write a proper story, every event leading up to that point had zero consequences for your actions and now half way through the story you throw in a random curb ball? Fuck off.\n\nAlso my 45 hours, like, 36 of them or so was AFK. I a little over half way in the story if I had to guess. I was level I think 20?? or so.",

The story is incredible and it is very evident that CD Projekt Red poured heart and soul into making a lasting RPG. I have never played an RPG that truly felt this big. Sure there may be maps in other games that are bigger but Night City feels more expansive than games in the same category. Cyberpunk looks cool and the gameplay is even stronger. Overwhelming at first, but manageable as you progress through the first stages of the game. I can't wait to see what more the devs have in store for us.",

There are still very minor bugs but nothing game breaking and almost all can be overlooked.

Gig after gig, Job after job. Its not perfect by all means but its gotten much better from what I have heard about in the past. it has a amazing story behind it, and I started playing before watching the Netflix Cyberpunk Edgerunner series. Which by the way, I do not usually watch anime but HOLY shit that was such a good show. This game did not come without its bugs though, Had to restart my first play through, thankfully not too far into the game. If you can overlook sometimes (but very rare) frustrating bugs then you should definitely check out this game. Also from time to time the game would crash and of course revert me to my last save. Which at times could set me back pretty far. (Tip for newcomers, SAVE, SAVE, SAVE all the time!!!  Do the side jobs and don't rush through the story. Look in every nook and cranny, you'll never know what loot you will find.",

There are still bugs here and there but honestly what game doesnt have them at this point, its like Skyrim. The bugs give it the characterization you can atleast see and laugh at because lets be real, we asked for the most intensive game to top even Crisis 3 and CDPR delivered. All in all, I recommend not for the first playthrough or the campaign, but everything in between, the small details that connect over time and the depth of characters that honestly dont even mean anything to the story, its all the side quests and lore that makes the almost 9 year wait worth it.",

        "content": "[b]Summary[/b]\n\nThis game is an fps open-world game a bit similar to GTA except it's more sci-fi and you can equip yourself with cybernetics.\n\n[b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b]\n\nAs for the gameplay, in simple terms, you go around to do quests and gigs. While doing quests/gigs, you can choose whether you want to go loud or be sneaky sneaky. What I really love about the gameplay is that there are many ways I can do the quests, whether it is jumping in and go ham hacking and slashing my enemies or staying far away to snipe or just watch them die from viruses uploaded in their brain socket by me.\n\n[spoiler][i]you can own an iguana and a cat and you can pet the iguana though sadly not the cat. Still love it 10/10 (\u2500\u203f\u2500)\u2661[/i][/spoiler] \n\n[b][u]Difficulty[/u][/b]\n\nThere are 4 types of difficulty, easy, normal, hard, and very hard. The difference between them is how aggressive the enemies are and how high their attacks and health are. On higher difficulty levels, you have to pay attention to develop your character properly and once you have developed your character, it will be much easier to come your quests\n\n[b][u]Story-wise/Quests[/u][/b]\n\nAside from the goddamn sexual shit, the storyline is okay and the side quests are not there just for filler, each side quest has its own interesting story.\n\n[b][u]BGM/Graphics[/u][/b]\n\nThey have a wide variety of bgm and each of the bgm is neat and the graphics are awesome especially when it's night in-game.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nBy putting aside the small glitches and npc t-posing, it is a relatively good game. The number of details they have added in the game are goddamn (\uffe3\u30fc\uffe3)\uff42 example the secrets and easter eggs. I do hope they make a \nmultiplayer option as its gonna be more fun playing with friends",

However, the fun I have had, the builds I have made, and how cool I felt being a cybernetic warrior were definitely worth it. If you like Deus Ex but want more of everything, this is a great game.",

The world the game is based in has colorful scenes and you can tell there was emphasis around the main plot in particular. I feel that the team probably had great confidence in the main story but leaves the biggest critique I have for the game. Lots of the RPG aspects that were promised seem to have been left out (probably due to time restrictions). I was really hoping to craft a more in depth V and have a better character backstory built by me. If you can get past some of the glaring faults, there is a fun game to be played. Gigs, side missions and the story are great fun. Right now I have a blade build and feel like a killing machine in slow motion with the cybernetics in game. I would say that abilities will make this game replayable, not the choices made in the story. (definitely not like FNV or Witcher 3 in that regard)",

All in all I'm impressed and are really enjoying myself. Recommended!",

Night City really feels alive, with all its various districts and random conversations of the populous going on in the back ground.  So many things to do outside the main story.  Characters are well written and you care about your allies.  It has crashed on me three times since I started playing so far, no big deal.  This one is a big thumbs up.",

I'm a big fan of FarCry, Sniper Elite, Elder Scrolls, etc. The graphics and environment on this make those look like a joke. The city is populated, especially around your first apartment. This game excites me about what's next and where those will (hopefully) go.\n\nThe atmosphere makes this an amazing game, all the little details they put around constantly crack me up. Without mentioning the actor in here and several of his movies that are clearly inspirational to this (especially his 1995 cyberpunk movie), or others from that era. Details like the 3 seashells crack me up. Quite a bit of NSFW in here if you can only play around family.",

CD RED PROJECT did not deliver what they had promised us, at least on the release date. It has been nearly 2 years since its release and there were many patches, updates, mini-dlcs. Since December 6th 2020, the game state has changed for the better most of the time, the gameplay feels smoother, better, the city is a city and not a desert full of buildings with no people. Of course there are things that could be better, as an easy example would be the police(NCPD), they aren't a challenge at all or instantaneous kill you. The requirements to play this game aren't low, and you need to have a decent computer. However, I would recommend playing this game at least once, the story is the thing that sales this game, it is a masterpiece. The story of V (both male and female) is incredible, the subtle details, characters, setting are like Keanu Reeves said \"Breathtaking\".",

I haven't run into many of the bugs that plagued the game at launch, but there were a couple little things.  For example, coming around a corner and finding one of the city people just floating over a road and random other silly visual things.  Nothing game breaking.  There is a lot to do and some very interesting and disturbing side missions that are definitely worth playing through.  Graphics are nice, atmosphere is great and appropriate for the genre, music is good and draws you into the world really well at times.  Overall, I would give this game a 8/10.  Good game.",

While i still experienced some bugs that were annoying like gun damage decreasing randomly and interactive  NPC dialogue  not being there and just having to reload fixing it. The hilarious glitches it encounter mostly were with the cars randomly exploding in buildings, or be launched across the map randomly/ Overall, it was an amazing  game and had many laughs with Johnny and V. While it still has some issues, it has come a long way and definitely worth the pickup. Mods also make the game way better too than it already is. Give the game a chance, you wont regret it.",

I prefer to play them  rather than talk about them but on this occasion I feel it necessary to make comment only because perhaps if enough people speak up, this franchise could continue.\n\nAt launch, I played the game on an RTX 3090. It was  a good game and I didnt have many of the issues that others did with console versions and those using less powerful PC's. It was a great game that I enjoyed and would have recommended but it was poorly optimised and the developer should note that.\n\nI have now played for the last two days on an RTX4090, and using that tech, this is likely the most beautiful game I have ever played. Set to Psycho level, the RTX graphics are simply phenomenal. A bit like Doom 3 before it, this game was clearly developed for a tech that did not exist as release. Whilst that may have been a bit dumb for the developer, it means that we now have a simply phenomenal game.\n\nPlease, please, please keep working on this title. With the current gen hardware, the game is amazing. Lets see some good DLC and a continuation of the franchise.\n",

The weirdness and plainness of this game pulled me out of it so often it's hard to have fun. It feels like Prototype with added bugs and less powers. I've got 180 hours in game, and very few of them felt special. It's gotten better since launch, kind of. I guess I'm dissapointed in the fact that this was so close to being an excellent game, but hit just out of that bullseye. If you can get this for under $20USD, I'd get it, but any more than that (future patches and free dlc notwithstanding) I wouldn't.",

The end boss will be hard if you only do the main story as it seems the ending of the main story assumes you are close to level 40 . If you only do the main story you will be around level 18 to level 20 at that point.\n\nThe parts with \"Jonny\" get annoying towards the end of all 3 story lines. It follow the character progression and it makes sense for it to say and do what it is but still it is annoying in my mind.\n\nThe game play reminded me of Dues Ex: Human Revolution but done better.\n\nIt has around 70 ~ 80 hours worth of content if you want to do everything but after the ending of the main story  it made me not want to continue.\n\nBosses being able to have anything and everything you can was new and i wish it took off as a game mechanic. As it came out 2 years ago i guess it didn't. The part of no enemy leveling with you is good though means you can be way over leveled but also a 1 hit kill to an enemy that the placement and how it is written  seems like it was intended to be a minor enemy.\n\nThere are still bugs that make the game freeze. Most of them with optional bosses. Not a fan that i have to wait for the boss to get a health bar to hurt it.",

I'd say it's around about as buggy as Skyrim as in when it happens it's usually hilarious and needs to go straight to reddit. \n\nThe main story is relatively quick which is it's main downfall i think; it's awesome but most of your time will be spent doing side quests and other gigs (which are still pretty awesome).\n\nEvery replay is different with the amount of builds you can do (sandevistan/slow time and 100 sticky grenades go boom boom) and you can be really creative with your playstyle.\n\nLooking forward to more updates/CDPR's next project.",

I wish it were better in those ways because the purpose is to transpose you into an interactive environment that you can believe you're a part of.  These failures serve as significant reminders that you're simply playing, not experiencing.  It's the difference between good and mastery\n\nWhile it could be better, its probably also true that the developers would have gone under with this effort due to the \"no one can get their hands on a PS5\" conditions that affected their decisions and they deserve some slack for what they had to work with.  It's a fun game, full of worthwhile, engaging content.  I might actually play through with a different build and opposing gender with a less compassionate attitude because the dialogue is actually different enough and feels like it matters.  Full disclosure, I stopped caring about replayability years ago because I never actually play it again.  Buggy, but real feeling characters and textures make up for the polish and if you started late like I did, you don't have to worry about being bitter about the way it was at release.  It's worth a play now, I think.",

        "content": "When I first tried Cyberpunk 2077, it had already gotten waves of patches and content added. I ended up refunding it because of the frontloaded information and mechanics (that tutorial shard...). I did not have any knowledge of the lore the game builds on to push me through it.\n\nThen Cyberpunk: Edgerunners got released. A means to understand the world of Cyberpunk, and enough to convince me to try again. I am very glad I did. What initially was a frustrating depth of mechanics became enjoyable, as I instead learned as I played rather than try to remember everything the tutorial shows. There is a lot to the game, far more than I could express in a review, but a few main things:\n\nQuickhacking is great. Major DEUS Ex kinda stuff, and fits any playstyle depending on what ones you equip (as well as what you place in that cyberware slot). Melee character? Make their guns backfire, blind them, disable their movement. Sneaky beaky sort? Deafen and blind them, wipe their short term memory so they don't even react, or just knock them out with enough RAM upgrades Interact with stuff all over the enviroment to distract, redirect or debuff. Guns Blazing? Debuffs, stuns, turn robots on their owners, trigger traps, make things explode, make other things explode, make people explode.\n\nWhile the street interactivity is a bit of a let down (only some food stands and shops are usable, stuff happens which you cannot do anything about though you can stop extortion and robberies if you see them), the Quests (Gigs, NCPD Scanner Hussles, Cyberpsycho Encounters) interact with each other and the main story all over the place. It really feels like your actions are reacted to, unless those actions are randomly dropping in from the sky in which case nobody acknowledges it, and acts like you took the intended route.\n\nJohnny Silverhand. The ghost in your head, shows up and often provides his own perspective, advice, or direct help. Kind of like a companion, but with more depth since he is a main character who is always a story factor.\n\nGunplay feels bad up front, but it gets better. For me it mostly came down to using file tweaks to select a much finer sensitivity instead of large jumps, and using single fire guns with the aim assist mechanics disabled.",

        "content": "Truly a phenomenal game, if this had come out this year, rather than 2020, it would easily make the top 20 lists of anyone who appreciates games as a unique form of art.\nI have never played a game, or even enjoyed any kind of media, that has made me feel hatred for a fictional location like 2077 has, it truly captured the spirit of the original RPG and I can't really think of a different studio that could've done better to iterate on Pondsmith's works.\n\nAlright so now for a more objective look:\nThe Mechanics:\nGunplay; pleasantly surprised by how satisfying it was to shoot all of the guns of this game. Speccing into pistols is fun as hell. Only detriment I'll say is that the ricochet feature barely ever comes into play, yet I find myself using near-exclusively power weapons because of how good and abundant they are.\nMelee: well developed for a first person game mostly focused on shooting and hacking. But melee combatants are kind of stupid bulky thickheads who just run up and do the same attack animation every time.\nCybernetics in Combat: Stuff like Sandevistan is fun, but Quickhacks are too versatile to give up, especially when you get the legendary ones that grant passive abilities. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of variety in leg implants, however, equipping a smart weapon and double jumping around combat feels like I'm playing a very weird version of Titanfall. Other than that, get kerenzikov, it's just cheaper, smaller, more reuseable, sandevistan.\n\nThe Aesthetics:\nGraphics and Environment: Night City is beautiful, and after I don't know how many patches, the game is actually pretty well optimised. I have a lower end of system capable of playing this game and can still play with a high level of detail while only having occasional spikes of frame loss (fewer than 1 per hour).\nMusic and Score: On my first playthrough I didn't appreciate the OST nor the radio tracks too much, on my second I really allowed myself to be absorbed in them. The OST, radio tracks included, is not the best I have ever heard, it is probably the most fitting soundtrack I have come across so far. The in-universe songs feel like products of the world, and the score feels like a soppy drunk polish rockstar kicked half an orchestra out and replaced it with their mates, in the best of ways. Oh, and the Mikoshi theme hits harder than Truth Revealed did in The Line.\nCharacter Customisation: It has enough tools to make a unique V for each playthrough, however, is lacking in other respects, there is a lot of aesthetic cyberware that is present on some unique characters that V has no access to, and the body scars and tattoo options are abysmally limited. I don't know why pronouns are attached to voice, of all the arbitrary factors to attach them to voice is the least jarring, but it's still arbitrary. Why is genitalia customisation even in this game? I appreciate manscaping as much as the next lass or lad but you're only ever able to see it in game in a few frames between walking up to and backing away from a mirror, and most mirrors still aren't large enough to capture that, you can't even view it during \"those\" scenes.\n\nStory and Missions:\nDon't make the mistake I did, don't chase down the main plotline because of how V's deteriorating condition is presented, you'll reach the step right before the point of no return and realise you've barely met kerry and river.\nBut, I am saying this because I think that all of the side missions are worth playing in this game, the ones with arcs compliment the main story well, and the standalone ones can be fun or fucking terrifying or depressing. Everything from nicking the car of a wannabe batman, to finding out that a previously wholesome character is just as fucked as the rest of this City, to nailing a guy to the cross.\nI've seen some say that this game isn't truly part of the cyberpunk genre, being a fun but flawed tangent to it instead.\nTo this I wholeheartedly disagree, this game dives deep into the meaning of the distinction between organic sapience and a talking few thousand lines of code forming a feedback loop, and whether that distinction even exists, a core theme of cyberpunk taking from the philosophy of cybernetics.\nYour relationship with johnny changes how he interacts with you when shit gets dicey, keep an eye on that % in your menu, it does matter. As for the finale of this game, I experienced quite a few strong emotions while playing the endings; but that's likely due mostly to the order I played them in. Without spoiling anything, I played through the pills ending (if you know you know), the worst ending, the best ending, and then the cool endings. Temperance still fucks me up to this day. If you're a Judy fangirl like me, I'd recommend this order.\nWhile I'm speaking of characters, all of them in this game are amazing, and they are beautifully voiced by both established and relative newcomers to the industry. With that said, I gotta recommend you choose femme V for Cherami Leigh's performance, I love masc V but you can tell he's a euro putting on an accent and it's enough to take me out of it on occasion.\n\nOh and Silverhand is Keanu's iconic role in my mind now, I always like that he essentially plays himself in most works, but in this he plays something barely recognisable as Reeves and it works. He pulls of being an arrogant arse and a genuine friend simultaneously, the fact that Silverhand is a class archetype from the RPG is just the cherry on top.\n\nAll in all, solid 9/10. If this game had the extra year or so that (from what's been reported) the devs wanted, it could have reached a 10 for me. It's definitely one of my favourite games of all time, possibly my favourite narrative in a video game.\nAs for bugs, went through playthrough 1 with nought. Got some more in no.2 but to be fair I did also mod Panam to be a lesbian so that might be on me.",

        "content": "Pleasantly surprised. Heard a lot of the negative stuff online but it was either over-exaggerated or the game has since been vastly improved. The gameplay mechanics and controls are solid for an FPS, though the driving needs some work. Also the pedestrians are pretty copy/paste and you'll see quite a few identical character models (sometimes including the same outfit). The story kicks ass. While it feels like some stuff has been stripped down and what you experience is a lighter version of something that originally went deeper, the game still connects successfully on an emotional level. Coming from the perspective of an audio engineer, the sound design of Cyberpunk's world is fantastic - from the explosions, vehicle sounds, music, dialogue and the impressively vast weapon effects to the well-placed silences, whispers, and even the footsteps of the player's character, the in-game audio pops out at you when something needs to be brought to your attention yet it gives you a rest when it requires subtlety. The pacing is pretty good for a story and world this big, and pretty much all of the training and the perk/attribute upgrades add something valuable and unique that helps to grab the player and immerse them into Cyberpunk's world. While crashes-to-desktop, random frame-drops, and graphical glitches do occur, they're rare enough as not to hinder the enjoyment of the game.\n\nOverall an 8 out of 10, excellent experience and highly-recommended",

        "content": "Cyberpunk 2077 was among the most highly anticipated games in history. Its brought to us by the same developers of the Witcher games which, is probably what made this game as hyped as it was. With all this hype this game was destined to be a failure for some, for me however it was probably the best gaming experience I have had all year. Despite the amazing writing it is just average in some of its \"RPG\" parts, this did not hinder my enjoyment much, but it might lower yours significantly.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2871151275\n\nThe Characters are the heart of the game. The story is great and raises interesting points regarding AI, our possible future and body modification, but the characters in this grim world are what makes the ending so emotional especially with what happens while the credits roll.\n\nHowever, V, is the in my opinion worst written one. The 3 live paths did introduce you to him but never really gave huge insights to any bits of his past. Every other character is believable, and you get to know them greatly, from goals, past to personal struggles you get to know everything about the people living in and around Night City.\n\nThe Characters of Cyberpunk 2077 are more than you might expect at first glance, the most prominent example here is clearly the man, the myth, the legend Johnny Silverhand. He is also the character most prominent throughout the story and the one that undergoes the most surprising but amazing development. The others are not much different though, they all are so well fleshed out and developed that once that ending hits, it really it's hard.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2872633456\n\n CDPR's worlds were always about stories and not about you interacting a lot with it. What you experience in this game you experience in the quests, not in any side activities. There is not much interaction with the world. Its mostly a stage for the characters to play on. You have an apartment, but it does not feel like \"home\" because you just can't do anything with it. Just don't go in it expecting it to be a Rockstar game, because it is not. However, the atmosphere in Night City is amazing, driving through the rain as never been better in any game i have ever played. Its also very detailed, you know by looking around in which district you are, what people live here and how they live.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2866260059",

        "content": "A whip-smart, dark and ingeniously plotted story, stunning visuals, excellent voice acting (especially from Cherami Leigh as female V) and a vast, immensely detailed open world you could live in for a year: Cyberpunk 2077, two years on from its disastrous launch, is a truly outstanding game. Take your time over it, because the more you put in the more you'll get out. If it has one serious flaw it's the pacing of the main storyline, but that aside it's an absolute blast. Admittedly I'm an addict of the genre - I cut my teeth on Bladerunner and Neuromancer way back when most of today's gamers were just an itch in their daddy's ball sack (sic), but dive into this with your eyes open and I promise you'll be richly rewarded. Just don't treat it as another shooter, because it's way more sophisticated than that. And make sure you acquaint yourself with the lore before starting off or a lot of what's happening will wash right over you. Personally I enjoy playing from an entirely first person perspective, which works brilliantly here, and I never use fast travel. Wandering through the mean, neon-lit streets of NC late at night is a joy, especially when a sandstorm's brewing, or in the rain when the colours refract back off the wet tarmac and you can almost smell the heady aroma of synth beef and fried locust coming off the food stalls. Stay safe out there, Chooms!",

The gameplay while basic, is engaging, and the characters are all well written and not the monkeys that reside around most RPG studios. The visuals are graphically impressive, and that is helped heaps by it's stellar art direction.\n\n This of course, had the *rockiest* launch that a game has had in recent memory. There is quite a few issues (that might not even be issues, depending on the person.) \n- The difficulty is done in a way that doesn't really reward skillful play, but instead jacks the numbers up and down.\n- The bugs even now are still present. They aren't the truly game breaking ones that they used to be, but are more hairline fractures in the detail of the overworld.\n- the gameplay is not going to be winning any awards because it's basically the standard package of shooter gameplay with a hacking interface built over it. sure it has more movement, but it feels like a lot of missed opportunities than anything else. There was a chance for some truly wack stuff\n- Most of the main and sidequests are good, but there is a lot of filler content that seems a like it's padding for time\n- The game is very easy to break, damage number wise. Quickhacking is also pretty busted, this game would be *hell* if it had Dark Souls style multiplayer.",

The PC version has always been running quite decently though and now, after a few major patches, that's more true than ever. And then out comes a truly brilliant game. It's extremely pretty to look at and offers many different ways to build your character and approach combat. It also has a ton of content, although the main mission itself isn't beefy. 100% recommended.",

        "content": "The game has problems- textures taking way too long to load in (preventing continuing story quests/talking to npcs), and just running down the road to face will have you running into swarms of polygonal humanoids, who will become normal in 10-30 seconds if you're lucky. Sometimes quests bug out- leaving you to either have to work around the error or reset to a previous checkpoint. AI can be dumb as a bag of rocks- but don't count on them ever missing if they do get you in their sights. And some encounters feel way unbalanced in the games favor, especially one side mission where I had to lob grenades from cover for five minutes to actually complete it. And this was a mission received very early on. Didn't beat it until the near the endgame. \n\nBut, the story is fantastic. The characters, their stories, the world (when it loads in) is captivating, and I really do believe that the leveling system offers a lot of replayability, because each encounter can certainly be solved in a multitude of ways depending on your kit, whether that be stealth, tech, guns or just punching out your enemies. \n\nIt's a unique kind of tale- asks fun questions about life, our world, its potential future. It's not a game I recommend buying at full price- But, assuming it becomes more playable over time, I advise you get it on sale- the further in time from this review the better.\n\nDon't expect your perfect edgerunner fantasy- but if you buy it, buckle up choom- you're in for a ride.\n\n",

I enjoyed every single minute that I played. 26hrs on a first playthrough, and started a second one just for a different ending, and more choices. I love this game.",

This is no Skyrim or Fallout level of immersion. Many missions feel half assed or unfinished. Basically nothing you do has any real effect on the world. You can score different endings but at that point the game is over, so really no decisions you make change anything of import around you. Fantastic setting that feels weirdly empty and a little lifeless. Also, they have you doing work for freaking cops the whole game. Very punk guys.",

        "content": "Game is a lot of fun and the characters are written and acted very well. \n\nThe major issue with this game is its \"Save File\" system which makes game save files critical to its stability. Why did CDPR choose this save file system to keep track of your loot? Because it's cheap (they don't need to host a database) but they did not bother to add a verification system, integrity check system, logic, etc. to the save game system. Nope, just a simple massive local running .DAT file that keeps track of your entire progress in the game. \n\nYou know what is constantly crashing my game out of nowhere? I am crafting a weapon, upgrading it, and when I craft it again and click the Upgrade menu item it crashes. I can reproduce every single time haha... I am using in-game features and it crashes instantly. \nWhat's the fix? Load a previous save and hope for the best. That's right, you need to undo your own progress and literally hope that you got it right... in what world is this acceptable?\n\nPSA: If you want the best chance of not having random crashes consider the following:\n- Don't collect random junk to dismantle later (Yes you read that right, a loot game that can corrupt its own save file mechanism due to too many random items)\n- Don't use any mods. (Mods are awesome - Hello flying cars!) but running Mods can permanently corrupt your save file and issues can arise immediately or later.\n- Don't use stat modifiers or trainers. (Again they can corrupt your save file)\n--- Starting to see a trend? ---\n- Don't save manually too often. (Yep, even this can mess with your stability)\n\nBasically folks, either you just play the main campaign and side missions or chance it by exploring and looting everything the game has to offer.\n\nAnd even if you play \"vanilla\" you will constantly have to fear the game saves and wonder if a corruption is coming that will force to lose progress or outright have to start over from scratch. This renders the whole prospect of discovering hidden objectives and trying to be a completionist entirely moot.\n\n\n",

        "content": "This game is a milestone of unfulfilled expectations and broken promises. Yet a game worth buying when on sales.\n\nI love the genre, I loved the gameplay of The Witcher 3 and I wasn't expecting too much from this game after all this bad news after its release. I waited over a year before buying it on sales eventually.\n\nAs most people say, the story is memorable and well done. However, the open world is flat and dead. There is no relevant interactions beside the story and even the story has little to no impact on how the world reacts to the player. The interaction with the world feels pretty soon repetitive and nothing to actually care about. Yet, it looks good at a glance.\n\nCombat is mediocre  and often feels random in its outcome. There are bullet spongs at every corner and hacking + steath is in most cases the best option to win quickly. (Or you use unballanced and OP builds to anhilate anything on sight.)\n\nAbout hacking and stealth: Both are a strength of the game and I really enjoyed doing hacking supported stealth missions. For me, it felt ballanced and rewarding. Unfortunate, the game forces you to use brutal force in some missions.\n\nTalking about rewarding gameply: The loot system is horrible. I have no idea what the devs were thinking, spamming the player with items that are easily overleveled ever 10-15 minutes. You found a legendary item giving a big upgrade? It will be replaced by any white item very soon. This is particually annoying if you are like me and trying to stick with a certain look. There is no elegant way to stick with your look AND have good items equipped at the same time.\n\nAbout quality and bugs: Like most ppl say, this game is still full of immersion breaking bugs, ruining cool story sequences because NPCs bug out and doing hillarious things. This is not too often, but hard to overlook.\n\nAbout driving: It is the worst thing I every tried in a PC-game. Anyother game I played sofare, did a better job. For people playing racing games, it is just insulting.\n\n\nTL;DR: Buy it for the story and buy it on sales. You will not get disappointed. Expect something like The Witcher 3 and you will hate it.\n\nNegative vote because of obviously unfinished but fullpriced product. I may change my vote if the game developes further.",

This only shows how incomplete this game was on release.\n\nAmazing ambientation, character design and world building. Sometimes I feel that the sidequests are better than the main plot.\n\nIt's a solid 7/10 game.",

It's been a while since I've had so much fun playing computer games.\n\nEdit after 140 hours played: \n\nThe game is _still_ growing on me! It is rising to become one of the finest games I've played. And I've played computer games since the 80s. Well done CD Project Red (CDPR)! \n\nMy heart bleeds for your talented developers who saw their game released in unfinished state and desevedly slaughtered by the market. The game should have been released after v1.5 / 1.6. I hope the game's renaissance currently going on helps the game achieve the fame it deserves.\n\nThis game is more than playable! It is stable and working very well. I've only experienced one crash and a couple of bugs. None game-breaking.\n\nThe only gripe I have is driving cars in this game. Works OK when going slow. Horrible and frustrating when going fast (unless driving in straight lines). Please CDPR: Learn from Saints Row 3. Super fun driving. \n\nIt is stupid how V - the main protagonist - with his/her computer-enhanced-brain and super-reflexes can drive the future-tech cars so bad. The amount a car turns when I tap the arrow keys differ wildly. Some times I can not make the car turn 5 degrees without pressing arrow key ten times.  Other times the car spins because I tapped the arrow key one time too much. I've driven for probably three hours combined and still struggle. Drifting around corners is messy and fails too often to be fun. And it is stupidly difficult to avoid dead stop because I snag a small singpost (strange how huge signposts can be run down while a small post can cause dead stop. \n\nI have enjoyed all missions in the game so far. But I delayed the driving mission, fearing how it would annoy me and probably make me rage quit. The mission is well told, well designed, and could have been super fun if only the driving in this game was better designed. My advice: Drive casually and slow 90% of each race. Avoid max speed. There's no point in reloading a save if you crash and spend like 20 full seconds untangling / unflipping your car: The other contestants are waiting for you right around the next corner (!!!). Completely immersion breaking. But this taught me to appreciate all the other stuff that _works_ in this game. When stuff works it is invisible. Kudos CDPR!\n\nThere are some great mods for this game. Want your own radio station in your car with your own MP3s plaing from a radio station carrying your name? Want better headlights that actually illuminate the area when driving in darkness? Want trashbins to be able to accomodate more than two bodies? More clothing options? I am still googling regularly in the hopes of finding a better driving mod than the ones available so far.",

        "content": "TL;DR Overall an amazing game, despite some very minor imperfections.\n\nVery rarely have I put over 100 hours into a game, and I'm not sure that I've ever put that many hours into a game where I enjoyed every bit of it. I avoided Cyberpunk at first due to the reviews and CDPRs notoriously buggy launches, and while I did experience a couple of minor bugs, they were limited to basic visual things like clipping. Nothing at all was game-breaking whatsoever.\n\nMain Story: The main story was interesting. There were some directions that story took, especially towards the end, that left me feeling a bit railroaded and disappointed by not considering my character and Silverhand's growth along the way in a satisfactory manner. However, overall it was still an interesting story that I wanted to see how it ended.\n\nSide quests: I love CDPR's ability to really tie the side quests and seemingly random encounters into the larger story. Silverhand's dialogue in unexpected places among quests that totally didn't relate to him was cool and kept me immersed. Even when doing side quests that could feel a bit grindy I felt like they were mostly worthwhile. The supporting characters were great and I enjoyed their quest trees as well. Panam's and Judy's especially; however, I still found River's and others very enjoyable.\n\nCombat: I really enjoyed the combat system. There is a lot of variety in weapons and combat style. Smart weapons, power weapons, melee weapons, cyberweapons (like mantis blades), and even talking weapons. While early on melee isn't really a viable option, as you progress and build your character you can totally take out squads of enemies with nothing but a sword. Very cool and a lot of fun.\n\nVehicles: The cars were cool, but terrible to drive. Handling was atrocious, and while I got better overtime it seems no amount of skill can fix the poor handling programmed into the game. \n\nI would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys single-player RPGs. This is probably the best single player RPG I've played in several years.",

There is just so much to do in this game it really is worth the money. If you ever get bored and need a single player game, I highly recommend it.

Admittedly I got into the game knowing very little about what was promised vs delivered. I did not follow the production and development of this game. I went in blank and was absolutely amazed with the atmosphere, the game play, and in the end the characters/story really stole it for me. I was a big Mass Effect trilogy fan, I enjoy horror games like dead space. I've played some AC titles and other open world games like GTA. I'm an 80's - 90's sci-fi fan and I love 90's music like Nine Inch Nails. For me this game has been so rich, and I have put multiple runs (and purchases) in on different platforms. In the games current state I cant recommend it enough. There is a ton of detail and despite how in your face the world may seem the details are rich and run deep, its a game best played low and slow. Don't plan to hit it and quit it if you really want to enjoy it. As dumb as it sounds you really start to develop a \"relationship\" with the city. The more you take time to simply walk, or listen to the radio, or look around an alley with no obvious loot the more you see how much work went into the title. I hope you take the time to pick this game and up and enjoy it. It's good to support this team. It may not have come out of the gate as a 360 No Scope highlight real, but its absolutely a hit and its on target and in the end, this team killed it. Love it or hate it, its the only game like it. That alone is worth the price of admission. It's an experience.",

        "content": "The game was so weirdly glitchy when it first came out that I quit playing. Retying it a year later and its a bit better, but still glitchy.  Every time I start the game there is a moment where all of the NPCs drop from about 12\" above the ground and slump weirdly. The exact same weirdly deformed NPC isn't present on every block any more, but you still see the same handful of distinctive people multiple times on a block.  Every so often when I check my wardrobe or look in a mirror my character's breasts glitch through their shirt.  Cars are still all but undrivable. Really important things, like the location of transportation nodes, don't appear on the main map (only on the very limited range mini-map) so finding your way around quickly is still a massive PITA.\n\nThere have been a number of cosmetic free DLCs that add clothing, and they finally implemented a system where you can pick a \"look\" and apply it to whatever gear you're using - so to have decent armor you didn't have to look like an idiot.  And yet, who cares? Your style makes no difference to any NPC - you could be naked for all they care - and there are no other players to see it.\n\nThe story line is good (what I've seen of it) but it suffers from the same problem as all open world RPGs. The story tries to give you a sense of urgency, but the gameplay actively defeats the urgency. You have 2 weeks to live, I'm certain I've played over 7 days in the game world (I can't be certain because there is no way to track time other than counting day/night cycles), and yet my progress on the main you're-going-to-die quest is still much less than 50% because I haven't hit the triggers to advance it.",

The story, the characters, the soundtrack, and the multiple play styles you can run with, from an adrenaline junkie running around with a katana, to a tank lugging around shotguns and LMGs, or a netrunner who clears entire areas out with a single quickhack.\n\nI wish Cyberpunk received more time and care before it shoved out obviously too early, but I still love it in it's current state nonetheless.",

I'm happy I've returned after all the updates and patches, my initial investment finally feels like it was worth the Eddies.\n\nThe city is vibrant and alive. The story is actually a story, which is refreshing when compared to the soulless AAA games churned out nowadays (definitely in part to the long history of source material & TBTG). CDPR is definitely pouring it all into this game, following it's dismal launch. After the police overhaul, I'd likely rate this game above GTA V. Looking forward to pouring at least a hundred more hours into this bad boi. Can't wait for the DLC as well. \n\nP.S. - Jackie Wells = Best Gurl",

It's like they wanted to make GTA4 only you took Doc's DeLorean time machine to a cheap replica of the future where it is missing depth and character and most buildings, cars, NPCs and backdrops all look the same. Dismal.\n\nAll that said, I still recommend you buy it on sale if you like a grind and lots of crappy dialogue to read..",

The braindance part in particular is such a wasted treasure trove of possibilities, it's insane. But there's a lot more where awesome stuff could have been had that failed to deliver. And, in the end, so did this game as a whole.\n\nIf you like taking pretty pictures in a dystopian cyberpunk world and don't care much about the rest then buy this game. If you're planning to actually play it and have at least average expections on the other hand then don't buy this game. You'll be disappointed. I know I was.",

What more can I say? Been there since day 1. Start as a Corpo on my first. Seen half of the endings. Stopped playing for a few months but then getting back again a month before 1.6. Night city felt like a hometown already. Start again as a streetkid on 2nd playthrough makes more sense because you're already familiar with the city.\n\nAnyway. Saving some eddies for new GPU so maybe I can start nomad playthrough with higher quality visuals. And more mods. The mod community is thriving.",

So far I am in love, this game brought my love for gaming back and manages to catch and hold my attention everytime I go back to Night City. The characters, gameplay, voice acting, setting, and story so far are what made me fall in love with this game. I think new players such as myself should give This game a shot and that old players who were turned away from the start should do themselves a favor and give CDPR a second chance and play this game again. I look forward to what CDPR has more in store for Cyberpunk 2077 and I hope as i play it will continue to keep my attention. Thank You.",

Just remember to turn off Cloud Saving as it delays saving in the game which can lead to excessive load times and gamebreaking bugs.\n\nIf this game was a 4/10 at launch I'd give it an 8/10 post 1.6 update.",

THAT PERSON NEEDS TO BE FIRED!!!!!\nCrashes, Game is very unstable.................Needs major fixing now. Maybe with  mods installed. CD should add the ability to detect outdated mods that might crash the game. Work with modder's game makers, they make your game better.\nMore DLC, id say don't charge but i now that's bs, but at least give me a clean and happy ending, no more riding off to the sunset like a western, for this game is not nor will it ever be a western. dumb chums",

This is the first time a game ever got me so immersed with all the options of how I the player wants things to go sure it always leads towards a single goal but it matters in the end (I feel). The depth the characters have is amazing to the point where you can actually connect in some way to them and actually makes you care for them. I know it sounds crazy but if you actually let your self get immersed its the truth. Finally the story is amazing yes it can be bitter or heartbreaking and joyous at time but its night city everyone lives and dies in this city there's no such thing as a perfect ending. If your thinking of picking this game up I would recommend it highly (For people that like story driven games)....   Its bitter sweet this game makes you wanting for more just like the Edge Runners series released on Netflix (yes there is a lot connecting the game and the series through eastereggs in the game) a masterpiece truly and I can only hope for more in the future thank you CDPR for a truly amazing game.",

The 1.6 update that was released has resolved a lot of performance issues and I am playing through the game once more. I have to say that I am enjoying the game much more this time around. \n\nSteamDeck performance is good, getting roughly 40FPS with default settings.  The only issue I seem to be having is occasional hard stutter after driving around fast for long periods of time.  If this happens, I simply drop a save, exit the game and re-load.",

        "content": "Greetings! Here at Thermohype, we're sure that almost everyone knows about the buggy mess that is \"Cyberpunk 2077\". However, this may not be the case for long!\nThe recent release of \"Cyberpunk: Edgerunners\" on Netflix has brought a lot of attention back to the game! In the last week, over 1 million players have gone through the\nstreets and slums of Night City. This is the MOST players they have seen since the failed launch in December of 2020.\n\n    Now, what has led to this influx? The release of \"Edgerunners\" has sparked new interest in both previous and new players to the series. This has caused a massive\nup-swing in traffic to the original title. 1 million players is nothing to scoff at. Cyberpunk's team has made it a point of fixing the game. While still buggy, the game\nis being fixed and has shown great improvement! Again, it is still not a perfect game, but it does show promise. There has even been an update recently. This update has\nadded eastereggs from the show. Definitely a great marketing tactic!\n\n    Could this mean the return of \"Cyberpunk 2077\"? That has yet to be fully realized, but the numbers seem to show a consistent interest amongst players.\nI (the writer) have played a fair bit since the newest update. I do have to say, it's definitely a massive improvement. Could Cyberpunk be the next \"No Man's Sky\"?\nWe here at ThermoHype are keeping our eyes and ears open to see if that may be the case! The Cyberpunk team has said that they are still working on updates. For us\nhere, that's something to look forward to!\n\nHOT or NOT Scale: It's WARM!\n\nSee ya later, Choom!\n\nNoobert And Grimzik with ThermoHype",

Such as the Skippy quest reversing the fire mode 50 kills in. I get that this is an RPG but I guess I'm just not that big of a fan. Also, I wished the iconic weapon damage scaled with your current level throughout the game rather than the level that your character was at when picking up the weapon. I did enjoy the whole loot and upgrade aspect though, and stealth is great in the game mostly until my revolver just doesn't want to focus on its target correctly. Wish we could also change car and gun skins without mods.",

        "content": "TLDR; I recommend it, it's a fun game. \n\n\nWhen I first started playing this game I got into the introduction to the first mission with Dex and then fucked off to go wander Night City at the first opportunity that I could. I hated the experience. \n\nI was in a massive city, surrounded by NPCs constantly, everywhere I went, and yet the experience was absolutely devoid of life. Sure, there were the occasional NPCs that would talk to you (about nothing in particular) or shout at you if you ran into them, but otherwise, it was just a city of blank slates.  The highways are massive and there are cars littered about going here and there, but even that experience felt hollow and vacant. I took some random turn off the highway and ended up in some bizarre corner with police cordoned off sections of roadway. Still nothing. It was just a lonely corner of some random road buried under the highway super structure shadow.\nThe game map feels massive and the set designs are, what I would call, damn near flawless. This is a beautiful game. Visually, you can get lost in it all just looking at everything. The problem with this game is when you dig a little deeper with adventuring and discover that it's almost all just superficial eye candy. Locked gates and trash strewn about entrances to hallways prevents you from straying too far off the beaten path.\n\nYou can tell this is the portion of the game that the devs were forced to sacrifice to release this game by the announced launch date. \n\nWhere this games truly shines and where you can tell the devs weren't fucking around with is in the actual story, story missions and even the side quests. The game suddenly feels incredibly rich, vibrant and populated when you're going about accomplishing what the story wants you to accomplish. Tearing down the highway getting to the next mission location  on a motorcycle everything blurs and life springs up in the most unexpected way, in that it doesn't do anything else beyond what it already was doing. I don't know why the city felt more lived in all of a sudden, but racing off to location after location, averting disaster after disaster the city felt more alive. \nThe music selection for this game is also par excellence that absolutely needs to be spotlighted more. Cruising the winding highways and random backroads of Night City would be vastly lonelier without those phenomenal radio stations distributing those amazing melodies and rhythms straight to my brain. Every bit a dopamine ride.\n\nThis isn't to say there isn't stuff to walk around and discover about the various characters and locations. The release of Edgerunners has proven that there's always been a veritable treasure trove of goodies to discover hidden throughout, be they tangible goods or noteworthy locales in back corners. \n\nThis game had a legitimate rocky launch, there's no two ways about that. I\"m 25 hours into this game and I'm enjoying the hell out of myself. This has been a most unexpected experience for me with gaming. CDPR feels like they're turning this game around, albeit, slowly (It's kinda like No Mans Sky in that regard). The updates have been clutch though, this game is playable now. It's beautiful. It's fun. I recommend playing it, especially if you're coming over after having recently watched the Edgerunner series.",

For those that need a couple games to be named that are alike this one I'd say Fallout and GTA to be put simply.",

Now, though, things have been dialed up to 11, especially on PC with a ray-tracing & DLSS enabled card. Wow, just wow. At times I feel like I\u2019m playing the most polished open world game ever created. The highs are just that high. However, then come the dips from those glorious heights. Enemy AI, impotent cops, and a persistent issue with NPC variety continue to haunt the game, but they don\u2019t come close to ruining the experience, especially after patch 1.6 (and I can import my Xbox save file finally!). I\u2019m biased, I\u2019ll admit. I\u2019ve loved cyberpunk as a genre ever since reading Neuromancer in college and having my mind blown. So, when I say play this game immediately, despite its rough edges, keep that in mind. See you out there choom.",

I'm not usually a first person guy.  In fact, most first person games give me major motion sickness, but with the POV opened up, camera movement and bobbing disabled, this one gives me no issues at all.  Wish I had ignored the naysayers and bought it years ago.  Only negative is that many of the online materials/guides are out of date (e.g. you can no longer get monowire before 20 street cred).

Since the launch CD Projekt Red stock prices have gone from 40 ish USD to just about 3 USD. \n\nThat being said they kept at it and low and behold they made a functional and fun game. The characters are actually well built and it actually makes you feel something. \n\nMost of the bugs are no longer a thing though at the time of the review I have come into contact with about 4. With that being said the new Edgerunner update made the game feel smoother and easier to play.\n\nI would have to say this is probably one of the best sandbox RPGs out there and at the very least it is my favorite.\n\nEdit 10/09/22: Just finished the game and the ending (at least the one I got) is fantastic, it is probably one of the best RPG sandbox endings out there. That being said it isn't RDR2 levels but it gives it a run for it's money.",

(Delamain's \"Epistrophy\" quests blocking all incoming calls, which stops completion of almost every side quest.)\n\nI've tried everything various forums suggested to no avail.\n\nI should've known when i saw t-posing in a cutscene 5 minutes into launch that this game is still a buggy mess but i spent the money and convinced myself it was a fluke. Maybe they'll fix it eventually and I'll actually be able to play the game.\n\n",

Cause i was afraid it would fail like No Man Sky did. so ill be honest, i pirated the first version, after months of its release, and bought one straight off. the bugs i saw from YT are gone, although the driving is a bit finnicky, some cars randomly exploding, when u barely touch em, or civs respawning every minute behind ur back, but idc, the storyline is beautiful. and in comparison to Skyrim, which has been out for nearly a decade, this one has less bugs, and if you disagree, atleast most of the time they are less severe. \n\nI dont regret my 70 EUR purchase not one bit. looking foward for dlc and updates.",

I enjoy the side missions more, and they are very fun. I know the game had problems on release, but after two years those are all fixed. I have no trouble playing the game, and the graphics are best I seen. The combat is also very fun, being action styled, not just a tab target, or click a button for auto attack. You have to aim and use utilities to defeat NPC. Even randoms on the street, when I merc for the police killing ganksters, my character has been defeated because I didn't plan correctly. I also have it on hard mode, which I would recommend. Easier settings make it just a story book, you enjoy the storylines, but there is no challenge and makes side missions boring. There is an even harder mode, but I think that is just for people that beat the game and want to try it. Playing it first time with that setting would be a waste, just as easy/normal modes would be.",

On boot-up, it crashed. Changing settings, it crashed. Closing out of menus, wardrobe, it crashed. You get the idea at this point. It has been nothing but pain and agony. It's been an absolute buttfucking of an experience to say the least. All I want to do is play the damn story. I just want to do the shooty shooty, bang bang, fuck the women, fuck the men. But at this point, I think I'll watch gameplay footage just to live the cyberpunk experience vicariously through someone else. The funny thing is though that the game was perfect when I first played it, when all of the problems that people complained about at launch were rampant. I don't understand... I just... I don't get it. How? Why??? It doesn't fiscally make sense. I'm within the specs range. AND STILL I HAVE T-POSE JACKIE IN THE OPENING CUTSCENE! I will do my damnest to get this fucking game to work. I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL.",

        "content": "I've been playing since launch and started out on PS4. We all know the state of the game at launch, and it was especially bad on console. But lets be honest, I know that I've played many a game that launched in almost or just as terrible a state. *coughBETHESDAcoughBIOWAREcough* But despite all the bugs, pop ins, and game crashes, I persevered though it because the core of this game was one of the best I had ever played! I combined a lot of what I loved from other open world RPGs with a futuristic aesthetic I had been craving. The characters felt real! *play female V, the voice acting is much better* The story is a wonderfully bleak and tragic tale that will absolutely suck you in if you let it. And Night City is the MASSIVE mega city I always imagined and it's slammed full of detail! Yes there is a lot of duplication of npcs and environmental objects but in a world this large and crammed so full of what you would expect to see in a city of this size, shortcuts had to be taken and, at least to me, is understandable. And its getting better every patch. I've always been a huge fan of dystopian future movies and the cyberpunk genre and CP2077 definitely did not disappoint in that aspect. I immediately fell in love with the game and still am.\n\nI finally got a PC right about when update 1.5 came out and have been playing it off an on ever since. You can definitely tell PC was the platform this game was designed for. Most of the major bugs had been ironed out before the 1.5 update came out but the quality of life updates and skill tree streamlining completely changed the feel of the game for the better. \n\nAnd now here we are at the 1.6 Edgerunner update and I'm in love all over again! This is the game we wanted and expected from the start! Is it a perfect game... no. But the realist in me knows there never will be. But for me, this one is pretty damn close and hits all those personal notes that makes a game stand out for me.\n\nAlso, GO WATCH EDGERUNNERS NOW!!! It will bring yet another level of enjoyment to the game... and sadness :.(\n\nAs a final note i'd like to say; Shame on you CDPR for releasing an incomplete mess of a game to us 2 years ago! But also, THANK YOU for never giving up on it and knowing that there were silent fans out there like me who were quietly enjoying your story and hard work, patiently waiting for it to become the work of art the we knew you intended it to be.",

I remember playing this game at launch and I got lucky with the low amount of bugs and issues I had with the game at launch. \nI also never followed almost all of the marketing, when it comes to games, I only ever find out enough to understand if it'll be a game that I'll like.\n\nThe story at its core, is unlike most other games I've played, and is one of the biggest reasons why I keep on coming back to this title. The 3 different paths at the start whist are interesting, leave a lot to be desired, streetkid being the worse one overall with the lack luster beginning and the lack of impact throughout the game, whist Corpo did the most, despite its almost nothing beginning. The main story was great to run through, as well as the weight you feel whenever you completely any of its endings\n\nWhist the RPG elements were mostly lost from this game, it felt like this story, and a lot of the other working parts of this game showed that at somepoint it may have had a lot more choice wise in the game. The side quests in this game were overall amazing, and you could always be sure that whenever you did one, you'll enjoy whatever the quest sent you on. \n\nThe gameplay loop has overall improved since launch, and the handling is so much better. If this game had more time in the oven, it may have actually pulled off something great, though that was likely never gonna be, but the game we got instead, whist flawed and filled with empty promises, is still a great time and a joy to be had",

        "content": "It is pretty safe to say now that this game has been fixed, congrats, you can launch it and play without any major bugs!\n\nWith that out the way, I can now give my thoughts on it.\n\nCyberpunk is a world full of rich characters that you will come to grow and like, a lot of them have story arcs for you to work through between the main story and it is definitely worth pursuing all of them, just be careful you don't get friendzoned and nearly die of cringe. One thing I absolutely admire about this game when interacting with characters is that you are not forced into a fixed camera angle as you get through all the dialogue between the pair of you. You are free to move around, stand or look where ever you like, which can help with the RPG element greatly!\n\nThe open world is expansive enough and there are plenty of side quests to keep you busy, but there is not a huge variety in them and nine times out of ten you are just going to go in there and shoot 'em up, needless to say that some of the side quests can get mundane fast, the side quests that involve actual characters and interactions are the ones to really focus on.\n\nThe game offers a generous plethora of weapons, skills and builds, so you better decide what type of play style you are going for and stick with it. I went for a hacker / pistol build and trust me, if you max out all pistol skills, you won't need any other weapon, it's pretty op.\nThe driving mechanics are still something that is hard to master, it really is quite sensitive, so don't try any hard turns unless you want to do motorcycle mid air 360's.\n\nThe story fits quite well with the world around you, everyone is out for themselves, corporations are oppressive and everyone around you in some way is suffering. It's a grim and brutal world lying under all those cyber enhancements and neon lights and the game does a damn good job of reminding you that. While I can't always connect with the main character due to on the fly personality switches, there are plenty of characters you can meet that you will form a bond with, some more than others. The main plot itself is actually kinda short, I think the game expects you to do a lot of side quests between all the main ones and to be fair, you do need to level up a good amount to be able to survive against enemies in certain sections of the city but once you reach a certain level, everyone becomes fair game, main quests or otherwise. The main story is captivating but I think mainly due to the characters you share the journey with otherwise it could actually be seen as quite simple.\n\nWith Cyberpunk in a good position technically and all the dust settled, I would definitely check out this game if you are curious about it but I would also say, get it at a sale price too.",

        "content": "I remember hearing about Cyberpunk 2077 around when it was announced. I was interested because I could tell that it would be a tough game to run - performance wise, and it had Keanu Reeves in it. Then when it came out... It was everywhere, and everyone said it sucked. It was a broken mess of a game that wasn't even finished, so I vowed to myself that I would never buy such a hunk of garbage. \n\n2 years later... \nI'm bored, it's a Saturday. I'm on Netflix wondering what to watch; I had watched A Silent Voice & Breaking Bad a few days earlier, they were both great in their own ways. Then, on the main screen of Netflix I see: Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. I think to myself, oh it's going to just be an advertisement by one of my favorite animation studios (Studio Trigger) that got paid to make this. I was wrong, the story swept me in like a storm and I was 200% engaged in all 10 episodes. \n\n1 day later...\nI can't stop thinking about that show, the characters, and even more that was in it. I look on YouTube to people playing some Cyberpunk 2077. \"It looks decent and actually pretty fun now,\" I said to myself. I saw on YouTube that you could get Rebecca's shotgun, David's jacket, etc. in Cyberpunk 2077 and I thought that was dope. I want this game now.\n\n2 days later...\nI see everywhere how the player count has increased to 50,000 concurrent players on Steam; just crazy, and the game was on sale at the time, right after patch/update 1.6, so at 10:15 P.M. I bought the game and sold some Counter Strike cases to pay for tax. I let it download and got on the game after I was done with everything I had to do the next day. \n\nPresent day... \nThis game is insane, I love everything about it, the details put into the game, and the constant care that CD Projekt Red has given it after the game's launch up to today & onward. They fixed their game, and made a true piece of art. I've played a lot of story-driven games in my day, but none come close to the absolute experience that this game has given me: emotionally, mentally, etc. I love this game and trust me when I say that the game is fixed now & it is my favorite game of 2022 so far. (even though it came out in 2020, patch 1.5 - 1.6 has made it a new game with all of the features and bug fixes that they've added) Also, they got over 105,000 concurrent players just a day and a half later!\n\nSome thoughts:\nThis game has too much to do other than the main story and (at the time of writing this...) I've sunk almost 40 hours into it already after only 7 days. It is an open-world experience to level the fun and quality of games like: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Grand Theft Auto: V, and much more. This game is amazing and I 100% recommend buying it. \n\nP.S.\nAlso watch the anime, even if you don't like anime that much, but you like this game... It's so great and the story in both the game and the show are breathtaking. 11/10.",

If you want to get lost into a cyber kinetic post-war dystopian future, look no further than Cyberpunk 2077.  \n\nAside from the fact this game has been plagued with bugs and crashes since launch, the story is amazing. I've put in over 50 hours and have barely done half the game only because there are so many side missions and events to do in free roam. You'll enjoy hours of game play as you grind to get eddies to level up your mods on your guns and yourself. \n\nIf you came to the game this year from watching Cyberpunk 2077: Edgerunners on Netflix, you won't be disappointed. Make sure you do the side mission to get yourself your very own version of David's iconic yellow jacket! \n\nAll in all if you can get through all the crashes and funny little bugs it has, you'll thoroughly enjoy this game as I have and continue to do so.",

        "content": "The game is not breathtaking, it's actually depressing. It's basically a dystopian porno for males. I can't say I would personally recommend it to anyone because it would just be too awkward, knowing the content. It is buggy (including game breaking bugs) with unpolished features even after all the updates (patch 1.6 as of writing this). I encountered so many bugs that I ran out of space to put them in this review, and will instead provide a count: 22 bugs, two of which were game breaking that I had to find a way around, sometimes with mods.\n\nCharacter customization is surprisingly limited and did not allow me to achieve what I was wanting. The hair looks very plastic. You can't play a truly hairless character, so when I was hoping to play a sexless, inhuman android with no nipples, etc., no-can-do. You can only have a stubbly head, human chest and genitals, and normal colored skin. Only sexy, human-looking people with hair follicles allowed. No ability to swap out limbs, etc., no cool metallic skin like some of the NPCs have. The only real \"cybernetics\" you see are a few lines on your face during character creation. The clothing is bad, with much of it looking rubbery/shiny or shapeless, and the hats being so ugly that I've never had one in an outfit in the entire time I played.\n\nI don't like the voice actress for the English-speaking Female V. She sounds like someone trying really hard to sound tough, but it comes off as cringe instead.\n\nThe game comes off as very \"male gazey,\" for a game that painted itself as somehow inclusive. A quest pushed me and a female NPC into a strip club filled with women, and the stripper image in the room was female. Why not a male stripper? The game constantly references male masturbation and images/fantasies that males want, and prioritizes sexy women over sexy men. If this is the future where you can supposedly swap out body parts at a whim, it sure isn't acting that way.\n\nAs evidence to the above point: there is only one romanceable male option for a straight female. The sex scene prioritizes your female character moaning like she's in a porno over the male character that you are romancing, who is actively made to shut up during the scene. Why would I want to listen to my character moaning over the one I am romancing? Typical.\n\nThere are loads of female NPCs to romance and have sex with. \"You can have a relationships/sex with women as both a man and woman,\" is not inclusive. Those are the top two porn categories for straight men. It's really imbalanced, and the romance system should have been done much better, with many more options. Having every romanceable NPC be \"player-sexual,\" like other games have done, would have been the only choice that makes sense in a game that claims that people can just swap their body parts into another sex. Of course they have a character in-game that has done this, but your own character and other characters don't fit this mold. Very surface level and illogical.\n\nYou can't swap your camera view to see your character in third person except when in a vehicle. This is weird and disappointing for anyone who wants to see their character running around and in action. Driving in first person view in a car is awful. Your character can barely see over the steering wheel, like someone who is very short/small/elderly. I have no idea why such a terrible camera view was implemented.\n\nWhy is the button for crouching and skipping dialogue the exact same key? This leads to so many accidentally skipped dialogue lines while attempting to crouch in high pressure situations. The F key is used for everything as well, and you struggle to remember to press or to hold the key on computers to get the desired result. There are so many overlapping hotkeys and they really mess with and ruin your interactions. The fact that you cannot rebind all hotkeys in this game is crazy for 2022. Why? \n\nLastly, after all of this: CD PROJEKT RED supports censorship in modding. They contacted a modder to tell him to take down his simple character model swapping mod. I strongly reject this behavior and believe that people should be able to mod their single player games however they want. Considering all the problems in this game, and the inability to make a truly inclusive game, CD PROJEKT RED should leave modders alone to fix their mess and poor choices.",

        "content": "After finally having seen pretty much all there is to see in Night City, I can confidently tell you that this is a good game. Combat isn't perfect, but it works enough to be very fun and addictive, as pretty much any build you work towards is guaranteed to be OP in the late game. The amount of choices you get to make is slim to none, and most of them don't actually matter until the endgame. There's still bugs and glitches here and there, but nothing like how it was on release, so it's perfectly playable and immersive.\n\nThis game is easily the MOST atmospheric game I've ever played. Most immersive too without being VR, which is astonishing. Every single street in Night City feels hand crafted, and nothing looks copy-pasted. Flow of missions happens pretty smoothly which adds to the immersion, similar to GTA V levels, except you could still walk away from conversation at pretty much any time unless it's a pre-made cutscene. The graphics are gorgeous, even without ray-tracing, and the sounds of Night City are perfect. Each weapon has its own unique animations and there's loads of detail packed not only in the weapons, but the cyberware as well. Once you start to learn more about the story in the deeper sense of the lore, the game really starts intriguing you to find out exactly what's next and how things happened to get where everyone is now. The character animations in pre-made cutscenes are essentially flawless, and some of the best animations I've ever seen. People seem lifelike during these scenes, they bounce their leg, they shift their eyes, they fidget, and most importantly, they express through their face accurately. Face animations are the real GOAT of this game and helps it tenfold.\n\nAll in all, grab this game if you're on the fence, it's totally worth it at this point, even for $60.\n\n8/10",

But with the continued support and updates from CDPR the game has been over-all improved. \n- Story: The story is gripping no matter what order you play it in. The character progression in the main quests is rewarding to play through. It is atmospheric and emersive. \n- Gameplay: The game play is smooth and fun and it gets better as you level up. There are a good many builds that you can create in this game so play is varied and does not get stale.\n- Loot: One sentence... Tons of loot and you can also upgrade gear that you like.\nTo sum up: I really enjoyed my 1st play though. From the gameplay to the story. \nKeep up the goodwork CDPR!",

        "content": "You've been lied to. The game is great and I'm enjoying it immensely! \n[[Pros]]\n-A fantastic first jump into the Cyberpunk genre. Deep philosophical questions, everyone is a walking computer, bright neon everywhere.\n-Mystery and layers to the stories makes it feel like many mini adventures strung together allowing you to have unique play throughs based depending on how you feel like playing.\n-Guns galore and plenty of options from stealthy bois to boom boom.\n[[Cons]]\n-\"Specific\" world/ story design choices. This is basically the only problem at this point and it comes from getting too invested. I love the characters and story so much that I start getting frustrated when things don't follow my personal head canon.   Basically the story is great if you want to experience Cyberpunk in a very specific way and although the designers did a fantastic job giving you many different perspectives, all that variety sometimes makes the game feel like a museum tour more than a focused narrative. You got to \"Go here\" and \"meet these people\" a lot and it gets frustrating for me personally. I really can't stand the desert cowboys and would prefer a solely corpo based story, but that's kind of defeats the point of the game. There are a ton of different varieties to the Cyberpunk sub genre and Cyberpunk 2077 wants to show you all of them. From the bionic street thugs to the digital voodoo wizards, you'll see EVERYTHING, and I sort of wish I could control the narrative more so I could stay where I wanted and not interact with the parts of the game I don't personally like. Like I said, you might love this game for this or you might be like me and wish for a more focused story. It's not technically bad, but you'll have to see for yourself.\n-The Open World is MASSIVE and the cars are terrible. It's so hard to drive on PC without crashing into things and that's lame because the shear size of the map makes it clear driving is part of the main experience. The world looks nice, but it's so big that a lot of things can feel samey over time. It's not the devs fault, it's a HUGE map to fill with content. No one can really fill it no matter how much time you have, but I wish they had taken a Mass Effect approach with limited zones so they could work on specific areas and develop them better while still having awesome sky boxes to imply there's a bigger world rather than having to try and fill that world and failing. The devs did as good a job as can be expected from this sandbox style and it's way more involved than Slyrim for example.\n-NO CYBERNETIC OPTIONS?!?!!?!? Ok, so to be clear, there are a FEW options for your face and there are two bionic arm textures you can get, but you're going to feel like the most human thing in the game compared to the wild cybernetic attachments NPCs  and the gangs have. I really think this is on the update list because how can you not have endless cybernetic options in a CYBERPUNK game?!!?!?! Devs, PLEEEEEEEASE add this. I want to have spiked feet. I want to have laser eyes. I want to have a sledge hammer for an arm. Please.",

The cars handle like shit ill say that much, but if they were made a little less floaty theyd feel fine. The story is dope, the world is immersive and the city is an actual massive maze of routes and roads and alleys and parkour bits. Its a fun game.",

        "content": "[h2]Intro:[/h2]\nI had been waiting for this game since that first E3 trailer waaaay back in 2013. I pre-ordered and waited through 3 delays so I could play on day 1. Obviously the release was a cluster, but for some strange reason I wasn't entirely disappointed. The game gripped me despite all the initial issues and backlash against CDPR. Here's my very opinionated review 280 hours in.\n\n[h2]Best:[/h2]\nThe best part of this game is the world of Night City itself. Besides some crazy future tech, most characteristics of the city feel true to the direction the US is headed in the real world: corporate greed, disregard and abuse of marginalized groups, insane divisions between the classes. Night City is not a perfect caricature of near-future life in the US, it doesn't ignore society's problems. Instead it outs the spotlight on them and forces you to live them. This adds compelling motivation to many of the stories and quests in the game by showing the player the true price of living in NC.\n\n[h2]Pros:[/h2]\nThe combat is very fun. There are a lot of options and except for primary attribute points you can respec all your skills. This means that if combat ever gets boring, the game leaves the door propped open for you to experiment with new weapons, skills, and hacks.\n\nThe cosmetic system is also a big plus. The most recent major update (1.6 as of now) added a layered wardrobe so you're not stuck looking like a clown during cutscenes, but can still have all the gear with the best stats equipped.\n\nWalking around and exploring the world is surprisingly fun. There are so many random Easter eggs, pieces of lore, side quests and amazing characters to meet that it really adds a sense of unknown and wonder (even in a world limited to a single city). Sure there may be the occasional graphical bug and the crowds may act funky sometimes, but the sights and sounds create truly captivating role-playing experience (If you're into urban living). \n\n[h2]Cons:[/h2]\nThe main quest line could have used a little more love. The pacing feels off at certain points and it seems like the main characters magically have knowledge relevant to progressing the story. Everyone's motivations make sense, but just adding a few more missions to pad around the major events would have really driven the story home. There are tons of side quests, but not very many that provide insight into the main story.\n\nYes, there are still a large assortment of bugs and graphical glitches. Mostly these are visual and just affect immersion and don't really hinder your ability to play through the game. If you go racing around full throttle guns blazing like a maniac, you're likely to notice these glitches more, as the game tries to keep up, than if you play with a role-playing mindset.\n\n[h2]Worst:[/h2]\nThe worst aspect of this game for me is thinking what could have been with better oversight and care from CDPR. Maybe if they hadn't teased the game so early, they could have given themselves an extra year or two to polish things up and let the developers' passion run wild. It feels CDPR over-promised and spent all 8 years struggling to meet their own expectations. It's just missing that final layer of love that only a few big RPGs ever get. I can only imagine how insane my first experience of the game would have been if it was free of major glitches, had a clean, user-friendly UI, and a more fleshing out of extras (looking at you public transportation).\n\n[h2]Final Recommendation:[/h2]\n[b]Until another game comes along that can offer a deeper and more compelling modern RPG world, I whole-heartedly recommend giving Cyberpunk 2077 a try.[/b] If you go in looking to pick bones, you probably wont have a very good time. If you go in looking to immerse yourself, you'll be in for a treat like no other (for now).",

The story is incredibly engaging and the characters have depth. The combat is difficult enough to be challenging, but not frustratingly overwhelming. The skill and perk system is well thought out and executed. The visuals are really stellar, and this might be an unpopular opinion, but I am glad it forces you into first person... the world just seems so much more engaging and real this way (I was a skeptic as well; why make such a robust character creation process to stick it in 1st person?) well, it works. \nYes there are some minor bugs, but most games have them. Whatever \"sins\" this game had at launch and those first few months, they seem to have been addressed, and what is left is an absolutely beautiful and engaging game. \nI highly recommend.",

Now with a growing stable of fixes, feature additions, and upcoming DLC it is a must add to your library if you're looking to lose a couple hundred hours in a cyberpunk sandbox.  Catch it on sale and don't think twice about hitting the purchase button, especially if you own an RTX capable rig.",

I truly feel like CDPR and Trigger did something magical with their game and anime some type of new form of immersion where I am able to be as close as possible to the anime characters and story in a way that book, games or shows alone can't compare, it makes the game experience much more real and almost familiar at the same time living the story in the show as if it happened personally.",

Needless to mention the most troubled launch ever made, this game had a hole lot of problems, and not only on the buggy stuff or the lack o content... but the concept of some of things that were actually there were... cuestionable to say something. It took time, but right know the game is in a sort of.... middle ground, it is not flawless but neither is the martyrdom it was on December 2020\nI bought the game some time ago, but chose to play it just about a month ago, the game was way different from what i saw online in the release and the months after release. I saw nothing out of the ordinary in terms of actual playability, everything worked and there was nothing i could think of \"was missing\" so i was content until a video popped up on my yt feed which was called something like \"1.6 update\" which was the version i was currently playing so i figured \"lets see whats new\", well.... many primary things i am afraid, such as changing the appeareance was brand new... yeah, 20 months after release, but it was there, so i can not complain... only feel sorry for those who had to wait that long for such a fundamental mechanic in a rpg. In terms of bugs, there are some around, not as many, and not as frustrating but there they are, the good thing is they no longer destroy your save of bug a flag for an ending or anything of the sort.\nThankfuly when talking of narrative i can say it is pretty damn good, the story is really nice, the characters, the world, the sounds and the lights of night city are nothing but gorgeous. My only regret is they didn\u00b4t wait until a making it playable (Like now i guess).\nSo, if you are new, play it, there are bugs, but we\u00b4ve got to a moment were the  balance between worth and worthless has aimed for the side of the worth, you should play this game, give it a shot, hear the story they want us to know. And if you suffered 2 years ago, you to should play it once more, maybe you don\u00b4t want to, and i get it, but right know it is a good chance to come back to Night City.\n",

Or suddendly forget what you wanted to do and do something completly different until you remember what you wanted to do in first place (skyrim i look at you), you can look like a mantis with bloody blades coming out of your forearms (wtf how fking awesome is that?!). You can arque with John Wick about stuff and get his clothes, his boots and his motorcy... um i mean car, or you could just watch cyberpunk edgerunners on netflix only to create a new character and do it all over again!!! and yes, lots of sex and violence...\n\napart of that, a beautiful open world with stunning graphics/atmosphere, great soundtrack and gameplay mechanics awaits you.\n\nTL;DR: LOTS OF SEX AND VIOLENCE - HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  \n",

(There are certain areas that even give you a shiver at dawn)\n9 - The most memorable characters we've ever seen in a game.\n10 - Map with several secrets, zones that are completely explorable and a lore of the game that reading the SHARDS leaves us speechless.\n11 - Even SR Hideo Kojima found it))\n12 - Moments of pure tension, sadness and chills are portrayed in an epic way.\n13 - Fantastic photography mode.\n14 - This game is a playable work of art and an excellent RPG.\n15 - Finally welcome to Night City)))",

It says partial controller support and so far I have been able to use my Xbox controller without issue. I picked the game up for $30 and honestly it's worth it. I put in well over 70 hrs back on Xbox and I will likely end up doing the same here on PC. If you never played due to bugs or the bad rep the game got initially, i recommend giving the game a chance.",

        "content": "This game got a lot of bad press when it dropped. I'll admit, I wasn't sure they could pull it off. I was pretty convinced for a while that it just wasn't playable.\n\nSome friends were streaming it recently. Weird, none of those game-breaking problems were happening. Didn't see that coming. Sure, the occasional silly animation bug, the occasional glitch or hiccup, even a crash after 6+ hours, but that's workable.\n\nSo I picked it up and gave it a go for myself.\n\nHere's what I've found:\n- Cyberpunk has SOME performance issues, they come and go even on a pretty solid machine. That's to be expected. This game has an extremely detailed world and I can forgive some occasional frame loss because of that. I just wish I knew why it happened seemingly at random, and then resolve itself after about a minute. \n\n- The animation bugs. Some of them are downright hilarious and catch you off guard, or last a split-second and make you do a double-take if you didn't blink and miss them. And if you run the same scene a second time, there's only a chance you'll see it again.\n\n- The gameplay is pretty versatile. Options aplenty for how you WANT to play. Different prompts for if you've heavily invested in one stat or another, to get past the same problem.\n\n- The characters are well played, show facial responses to a lot of what you tell them. Really makes you feel like [strike]Spiderman[/strike] you're in the world, talking to more authentic personalities.\n\nI've had a field day with this one, and I think this world would be outstanding to explore with another person. Heard rumors there'll be something like that someday. I look forward to it.",

It is an awesome game to play and it really brings to life the Cyberpunk 2020 TTRPG sessions I played with my friends during high school. I love that I world I could only see in my imagination was finally brought into an interactive medium like this game. I could spend hours exploring the city (and have) and never get bored.

I hope they continue the path they are on.\n\nI wasted a couple of hours having to backtrack after making a bad call but you live and you learn. Some of the choices really do matter which is more than I can say about a lot of games. \n\nYou can play the game with all sorts of different styles which is fun. I like to be more of a hacker with a sword and submachine gun. All out brawler, stealth assasin, run and gun, you name it. With the depth the game has, it would be cool to have a more in depth save/character profile manager. \n\nTLDR: Tons to do with fun, deep game play. Finally seems like they turned this things around.

I heard about the troublesome release (who hasn't) but I didn't have any expectations going in.\nI wasn't waiting for the premiere and I haven't seen the Netflix show yet. But I had an itch for a bit of RPG so I got Cyberpunk 2077.\nRight off the bat: I love it. I absolutely love the game. \n\nThose things that I love:\n1. The world: it is huge, it is beautiful, and - most importantly - it is ALIVE. \n2. The story. It's gripping, it is emotional, it is gut punching.\n3. The side quests. There is a heck a ton of them and they are all amazing. No fetch quests!! They also make me feel things. And also, for the first time in my gaming career, I failed the quest on purpose because I couldn't bear it. \n4. Judy, Panam, River, Jackie love'em!! \n5. So many things to do.\n6. So many things to wear.\n7. So many things to shoot with.\n8. So many things to hit with.\n9. So many things to drive in.\n10. The phone: calling and messaging my chooms.\n11. There are always at least two ways of doing quests.\n12. The other characters not mentioned above. They are all GREAT even when annoying. Fantastic VA. Those NPCs live.\n\nThings that I don't like:\n- driving was awful at first but I got used to it\n- gunplay was awful but I got used to it as well, although it is still not great\n- my V seems to know more than me and it can be both hilarious and frustrating. Just today I met with a client and V exclaimed: OH IT IS YOU! Yet I, the player, have no idea who the hell we were talking to.\n- So many things to wear yet most of them are goddamn awful\n- the game DOES NOT explain the hacking minigame\n- storywise the beginning is fantastic but gameplay wise it is tough. There are too many icons, information, choices, and buttons and you can easily get lost.\nBasically, I would say it is EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE.\n\nOverall though? I love Cyberpunk. I am invested in the story and the characters although it makes me depressed at times and I feel inevitable gloom and doom. I am a sucker for happy endings but I am not sure if I can get one here.\nWould I want to live in Night City? No, no I wouldn't but somehow I can't leave.",

At the discounted 50%, I don't regret my purchase. Not sure I would have paid the full 100% price though.",

        "content": "It\u2019s difficult to quantify just how good Cyberpunk 2077 is. It\u2019s like trying to tell someone you\u2019ve discovered the world\u2019s best cheeseburger. We all know what a cheeseburger tastes like and, for the most part, they\u2019re all fairly similar. But sometimes, a special, magical combination of ingredients comes together in a way that has to be experienced to be believed and understood. Cyberpunk 2077 is like that. It\u2019s an open-world, first-person RPG with hacking but it\u2019s also so much more. It\u2019s a sublime experience from the moment it begins to the end of the (35+ minute) credits. No matter what kind of gamer you are and how you like to play, Cyberpunk 2077 caters to you.\n\nPlaying as mercenary V, players are dropped into the fictional Night City and let loose. V\u2019s personality, skills and class are all shaped and developed by the player while playing. And they\u2019re never locked in to one specific thing. Are you a gung-ho, guns blazing, wise-cracking arsehole? Cyberpunk\u2019s got you covered. Do you prefer to sneak up on your enemies and stay tight-lipped? You\u2019re covered too.\n\nDo you want to tackle each and every situation, conversation, mission, combat scenario and traversal across Night City based on how you feel at any given moment? Well, that\u2019s also an option. The freedom to play how you want and be who you want in Cyberpunk 2077 is nothing short of breathtaking and the fact it affords players this level of freedom while delivering a seamless, fluid and engaging experience is mind-blowing. Many games buckle under the weight of their own ambition, but Cyberpunk 2077 avoids this pitfall and instead, creates an experience which is never less than completely dictated by the player\u2019s whims.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt Red has created a phenomenal tour de force and a game that\u2019s unlikely to be matched anytime soon. It is an important game and one that demands to be played.",

I never do that because it's fkn boring for me, but after watchin edgerunners I decided to give this game as much time as I can, and lemme tell ya - I'm happy that I didn't do this on release, because now I can dive into this game when it's in a more than playable and enjoyable state.\n\n-Even if it's your first time playing - look out for the mods available. Some pretty impressive stuff is coming out, and there is more to come. You will surely find something that fits your style.\n\n-Don't play this game on a difficulty below \"hard\". Trust me, I consider myself an \"arcade\" player, but CP feels too easy even for me on anything below hard (OR medium, ok, ok). It WILL be a bit of a pain in the ass in the beginning, but when you reach midgame with a nice build - it will become a walk in the park.

I felt bad I bought it at $30, this game deserves to be purchased at $60. I haven't encountered many bugs aside from 2 annoying ones that had a work around that I didn't mind. The graphics? insanely good. Dialogue? Amazing. It's honestly just a gorgeous game, with a great story, fun game play, and a thoughtful leveling system. I understand some hated it upon release due to all the bugs, but CD Projekt Red has honestly turned it around, and I'm hopeful for its future with what I've played so far. I have a lot of hours for the few days I've had it, it's truly addicting and a great masterpiece of gaming media.",

        "content": "So after completing a playthrough of the most recent update of the game I can recommend the game since I can without a doubt say that it was fun. If you have loved previous CDPR games you will like this game too. Notice that you will most likely \"only\" like the game not love it.\n\nThe reason why you will probably not love this game is because even after all this time the game is still somewhat buggy (though I had no major game breaking bugs). \n....Another reason is that the game suffers from a somewhat boring \"high dps screw defence or strategy meta\" when it comes to combat which makes it lack in variety to deal with enemies (armor values are practically meaningless on higher difficulties for example)\n....Another reason is that the (side-)characters in it are superbly written but the opportunities to actually interact with them are far and few (which is a damned shame). Like how awesome would it have been to have a Mass Effect type squad combat with the usual party banter to flesh the characters out? That would also have been way closer to the actual cyberpunk tabletop\n.... Another reason is that it bothers me to no end that a significant portion of the game is to help the corrupt law enforcement (event the game itself makes it clear that they are corrupt) through NCPD scanner gigs. Like the entire setup makes V out to be this rebel type character but a significant part of the content of the game turns you into a glorified deputy sheriff. Such a strange game design choice.....\n.... Though said last playthrough of the game made a better impression when it comes to the AI of enemies (compared to launch) it is till somewhat rudimental\n\nBut as I said: The game is still a lot of fun.....\n.... You can actually try out a lot of different build options; even on higher difficulties (as long as they conform to the \"high dps meta\")\n.... even the stealth gameplay is fun and suprisingly deep (especially when it comes to the hacking)\n.... The characters are great and the overall \"look and feel\" of the cyberpunk universe is definitely there\n.... Though it is a shame that most of the side missions are mainly driven by text logs and messages not through exposition of the ingame world (something that the witcher series did way better) they were fun though a tiny bit repetitive\n.... The game world is nowhere near as packed with content compared to the Witcher 3 but it is still a lot for one playthrough if you do all side missions / acitivites\n\nAgain: if you loved the Witcher series you will like (not love) this game too.",

I don't usually play games of this genre as I play mostly VR shooter games like pavlov and vail but this right here is probably one of the most fun I can experience in a 2d game as I have already sunken 45 hours in it within the first week. It all started when Rockstar Energy drink released their cyberpunk collab god knows how long ago and I really wanted the Car. Sadly I didn't win anything but I was really excited for the game, except for one problem, My computer couldn't run it, so I wasn't able to play the game when It came out. Now don't get me wrong, my pc is struggling to survive as I used to play VR esports at 25 fps with dips but this game with medium settings ran at an awesome 40 fps! That's fun and all but I have encountered some glitches. However nothing game breaking, I saw an npc slide around on its stomach, people driving or flying the invisible boat mobile and the random guy t-posing in the background or during a fist fight XD. If anything this just made my friends and I laugh in voice chat so god damn hard you'd think we were dying, this game brought out all the emotions from us when playing because I found the story to be really good! Even the side gigs have good stories and lore.",

        "content": "Up front: Yes it is demanding in terms of hardware, no not ALL of the bugs have been fixed. That out of the way, I still enjoyed this game from launch day, though I do acknowledge that I seem to be part of the blessed minority who rarely encountered anything game-breaking. Even then, the worst of the bugs have been dealt with, and by now several features that weren't ready at launch have now been fully implemented. CDPR is very much committed to this and still has plans for it, and if you have the hardware to run it properly, there is a wealth of content waiting to be discovered. Night City is well worth simply walking through, and oftentimes some of the most hilarious, disturbing, or just downright depressing and horrifying conversations come from random citizens on the streets. The main story has plenty of twists, but you're doing yourself a disservice if you ignore the ocean of side jobs and gigs scattered from one end of the map to the other. Rewards aside, some of the most memorable parts of the game are entirely optional, and going over the city like a fine-toothed comb will always end up being rewarded. And all of this content was designed with multiple approaches in mind, whether you want to play it quiet, go in guns blazing, or even sit outside and kill everyone by looking at them through security cameras. \nBottom line, this game is a diamond in the rough that's only getting more polished. Remaining bugs are largely superficial, and either easily ignored/fixed, or are genuinely amusing and not what I would personally consider detrimental. (Come on, a guy sitting on an invisible crate on a street corner like a mime is kinda hard to get genuinely worked up about) \nIf your computer has the chrome to handle this rough beast, and ESPECIALLY if you've watched Edgerunners on top of that, I strongly suggest you give the current state of the game a look",

Music choice is quite amazing, almost a nostalgic feeling. (Talking about 'major crimes')\n\n~The gameplay is, I gotta say above all the games I played, the most enjoying one. The rpg aspect, customizations, weapon choices, clothing, crafting, ways to play, all you can ask. A great escape to reality.\n\n~Few bugs and glitches but not major. Enjoyable at most. Can't talk about the graphics cus I'm running it with 1650s on low-medium settings, stable 30-60fps, but i'd say the visuals is definitely breathtaking! \n\nThank you CDPR\u2665\ufe0f",

Its by now a really interesting and enjoyable game with a good storyline. Some forced Wokness which is redicoulously apperently forced into the storry, could have been avoided or somehow nartually introduced. Seems like management forced inclusion of one of each category in the alphabet group. So just like in Far Cry 6 you will come across some forced indoctrination and normalization of woke culture where gener transitions, etc is brought up on a wimp without any relevance to the story. \nGreat graphics, runs smooth on my 2k 2560x1440 screen with every setting on ultra with a Asus Rog Strix 3080 OC edition card and a Core i9.  The game utelizes many of the techonogies introduced in the RTX 3000 series of Nvidia cards and their respective couterpart with AMD cards.\n",

I almost bought a PS4 to play on launch and thank God I waited because I was skeptical of all the hype. 2 years later i've been watching the updates and bought the game in the summer during the sale  and waited. then  a few days ago I finally got a medium build PC just to play this game after watching edge runners  and man it was worth the wait. \n\n1st of all for mid tier system (AMD RX 6600/ RX 5600) The game looks amazing in 1080 on Ultra /low ray tracing or on medium/high in 4k on my TV . The graphics alone make me feel like im having a real BD. Protip:  Eat a gummy or your item of choice and play this game at night on a big screen. :)\n\nMy biggest complaint so far is that I can feel the limitations of the story and its decisions. If you compare the cinematic trailer with the actual prologue you can see all of the changes CDPR made with the final product and its worse. What would have made this game next gen is not the graphics but having the game wildly branch off in the beginning. \n\nWhat if you could save Jackie? Or betray Dex or even kill the arasaka's then steal the relic  and what would happen next?  I feel like this is what the Dev's were trying to do but realized it was just too difficult and decided to do a traditional RPG so sometimes the game feels like its on rails.  I have not beat it yet so maybe that changes? I don't like female V's voice and  the NPCs are lackluster empty shells taking away the immersion. \n\nThere are still minor bugs and glitches but they are minor and do not happen often. If you are a fan of the cyber punk genre then this is a must own. Can't wait to try the mods. \n",

CD Project Red might have messed this game's launch, but they can at least make a good anime. XD\n\nUpdate:\nAfter playing this game again, I've seen bugs that I've never seen 1 month after the release, which is ridiculous and funny at the same time. Did the game evolve backwards? Hahaha. Regardless, I still had some fun, but when I realized that there is a secret ending, which is what I really wanted to do even on my first playthrough (I just didn't know that exists back then), it just irritated me. Because that's what I actually wanted to do if I'm not limited by the choices. The main character has been doing crazy gigs solo, so why can't he at least attempt the final suicidal fight alone, without requiring you to pick very specific dialog options from previous quests. Illusion of choice I guess?",

I had all the issues with it but knuckled up and dropped around 50 hours into it. I stopped after I heard a slate of patches were coming and figured I would be as well waiting since I was getting a new PC. \n\nSo I got my beast of a machine and dropped the cash on the PC copy and transferred my saves. Only to have inconsistent crashing. CDPR insists that I disable any software that uses overlays (or any software at all really) my sound drivers and invoke an arcane ritual to boot it up. Sometimes I get to play 4 or 5 hours with no hitch. Then I reboot and it crashes when I pause or access inventory or change the time. It's the inconsistency that is frustrating and the fact this has been an issue for months. Sometimes I delete the cache and get a good session in. Other times can't even get past the logo. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers and files and briefly considered installing an older version of windows before realizing I should not be jumping through this many hoops to play a game. \n\nI WANT to love this game but it is so hard to play it's frustrating. I am leaving this negative review to add my pebble to the hopeful landslide of pressure to make fixing this issue a priority.",

If you look at Cyberpunk and treat it less as what was advertised two years ago and more at a Witcher 3 Style story and open world system you'll probably go into expecting what should've really been shown from the game trailers (if the marketing wasn't pushed so hard). Story is great, world is beautiful, bugs are still kind of rampant, gameplay is mostly satisfying. Lots of well written side content and interesting characters. Really makes you feel like you're Cyberman 2077. Looking forward to more game updates and hopefully a decent DLC (or two)",

Right now, I think it is in an enjoyable stage, where you don't quite experience a critical mass of immersion breaking bugs, but there's still ways to go. It's not the ground-breaking phenomena CDPR prophesized, but it's a solid game as far as I've played. If you're a fan of single player immersion games, it's quite easy to drown into this one.",

Yeah u cant experience any of them cause resources either goes to the **buying intel** thingy -being spent, while doing the job- , or basicly they wont give you much.\n\nin conclusion, side quests are must to do, and i was almost finishing the game without any modifications or extra aggressive tools. Bit of a bummer.\n\n\n\nand extra info that rtx reflections literally gore smut BD's your a$$ with Johnnys' Silverhand tho if you turn the setting on, which is a bummer too sadly\n\nand, #Justice_For_Becca",

This is one game that I've gotten very attached to and one I play almost every day. I have over five hundred hours in this game, and counting. I've been playing since launch and even now, years later, I find and discover new things to do and see every play-through. There is so much to do in this game and the story, characters, music, animations, and acting, among many other things, are amazingly done and very unique, things that I've never seen any other game studio do before. This game has always been a blast for me, and with the patches and updates made by CDPR over the years to iron out any bugs and imperfections (and add in new features and items that are REQUESTED by the community, yes they actually listen to their fan base), this game has become even better. I one hundred percent recommend this game to anyone who might be on the fence! It frequently goes on sale, as well! I am so, so stoked to see the future of this game and can't wait for more additions by CDPR in the years to come!",

For PC players, this game has made leaps and bounds in terms of polish and fixes. While I was also disappointed at release, with game-breaking bugs and glitches, I am really enjoying my David Martinez Inspired run, and haven't come across any major bugs or glitches. CD Project Red is STILL coming out with patches, free content, and a new DLC is in the works. I am very excited to see what the future of Night City has in store, and I encourage everyone to give this game another chance.",

Literally impossible to drive in first person view, nearly impossible to look into sunny areas from being in a dark area, and making my eyes and head hurt.\n- Same for the sun reflections from shiny surfaces like glass or metal, which are incredibly and unrealistically bright, like laser beams right into your eyes.\n\nI have read that a lot of people have the same issues but stil no fix from the developers.\n\nI have tried every graphics and video setting in the game and nothing makes it better for these two critical problems. I have read that there is a mod that may help, but this is unacceptable from the devs.\n\nThere are also some other issues which are somewhat manageable (steering while driving is incredibly annoying, but can be made a little better via steering speed settings) or simply annoying (people and cars disappearing or spawning right in front of you; incredibly obvious scripted traffinc during missions; the other characters are incredibly hard to see in the darker areas because they are indistinguishable from the surroundings).\n\nReading the reviews, I have been lucky that only one of my missions has been broken so that I have not been able to finish it, but luckily this part of the mission was somehow respawned after the recent patch, so I could finish it after the patch - not sure if would have been possible otherwise.",

Pre 1.5, the game was pretty janky all things considered, but still held the same amount of world and story depth that i had expected and more, with pretty immersion breaking bugs that may take you out of the experience here and there. When 1.5 rolled around, there were a ton of fixes and general improvements to the game, alongside more interactivity with the world, namely the new apartments, as well as general balancing and polishing.\n\nAll in all, i'm glad that Edgerunners helped allow people to see the beauty of CDPR's Cyberpunk, alongside how everyone was able to give Cyberpunk a second chance despite its infamous history. I'm grateful to CDPR for sticking by Cyberpunk and acting on its potential, and i'd like to thank everyone again for giving this magnificent game a second chance, even if it is still buggy here and there.\n\n\u201cI am a forest, and a night of dark trees: but he who is not afraid of my darkness, will find banks full of roses under my cypresses.\u201d \u2015 Friedrich Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra",

Kinda Boring at some parts. \n\nFor those who can read: \nWaited a long time to write my review as I wanted to give the devs proper time to fix the game. After almost 2 years since release I can say that CP2077 is a playable game and was a fun experience albeit a bit boring sometimes. Some Callouts - \n\n- I wish it had been third person or at the very least had the dialogue done in 3rd person cutscene/cinemateic style like Witcher 3 had, would have made the game more enjoyable especially since you almost never see any of the gear you are wearing and the conversations with NPCs felt very odd. \n- The \"filler\" quests/tasks like GIGS, NCPD Scanner and Hustles, Cyber Psychos and- wait that's it. Just those three things? I know you can save all your money and buy all the cars but thats still not much (Close to 1.7 Mil eddies for all cars). \n- Driving needs work, never really felt like i had mastered the games driving mechanics after 100+ hours\n- Visually stunning and the theme is of course amazing, who doesn't like Futuristic cyberpunk aesthetic? \n\nOverall  had a great experience with the game but it lacks depth compared to something like The Witcher 3. Wouldn't pay a full 60 for it but if you can snag it on sale for atleast 30% off, get it! ( And if your machine can run it)",

        "content": "[h1] VERY MINOR SPOILERS [/h1]\n\nI was one of the many people who played this game near it's launch date back in December 2020, and...\n\nWell, let's just say that I didn't have many kind words back then.\n\nTo say the least, the game was [b]HELLA[/b] buggy at launch, from small bugs, like cars randomly flying in the air, to literal game-breaking bugs, some to the point where it was impossible to finish the game to 100% completion. Now, because of these bugs, and several more bugs and just general issues, this game was berated by people online, even resulting in CDPR getting several class-action lawsuits, and even being the victims of a cyber-attack [i](how ironic)[/i].\n\nBut, that was (nearly) two years ago, and whilst I still think that the game has quite a bit to go before it turns into the game that fans were promised just a few short years ago, I think that the game is in a very playable state at the moment, and I strongly urge people to give the game a second try after its updates and patches.\n\nNow, I don't want to dwell too much on the past, which is why in this review, I will be mainly be talking at length about how the game feels and plays today, after the latest patches.\n\n[h1] Cyberpunk 2077: A Comprehensive Review [/h1]\n\n[b]What I Like[/b]\nFirst off, I [b]LOVE[/b] the atmosphere and art-style of this game. It really does feel like a breath of fresh air compared to most other RPGs I've seen and played. Night City in general screams of a city that seems like the perfect paradise that most people would be looking for, when really, it hides a dark secret, that only residents of the city would know. Another thing I really like is that each district of the city has their own vibe, like with Japantown having virtual cherry blossoms and things traditional to Japanese culture, whilst the City Center has things for the rich, such as large buildings, and designer clothing stores. It's the small things like that which really sell the atmosphere of the game, which makes the city feel more immersive.\n\nGameplay is a big thing when it comes to games like this for me, which is why I am very pleasantly surprised to see that this game feels very nice to play, and has a lot of replayability. This is one of the biggest selling points of the game for me, the fact that it not only fun to play, but doesn't feel repetitive is one of the best things that a game can be.\n\nAnother thing that's feels good to mention is the amount of new features the game has gotten since release. Back in December 2020, the game felt basically empty, with V (the main character) only being able to own 1 apartment, and having very little decor in said apartment, aside from a plush toy you would get from signing up for a GOG.com account. This has changed drastically, with there being 4 new apartments that V can rent, and being able to decorate the original apartment, with new colors and moods. More new features include:\n\n-Ability to customize appearance (hair, makeup, etc) in apartment mirror, and being able to customize more thoroughly (eye color, face geometry, [spoiler]...genitals (yes, really.)[/spoiler], etc) at ripperdocs.\n-Transmog system (ability to customize and wear outfits without affecting armor)\n-New quests\n-Cross-progression saves\n-Many improvements to vehicles, economy, and combat\n\nAnd the last thing that I want to add on to this list of features I like in CP2077 is the modding capabilities. I think modding is a must when it comes to games like this, and seeing all of the mods available for this game really adds to the whole game in general. And thankfully, that will just continue to get even better, thanks to the recently announced REDmod modding tools, and I can't wait to see what modders will do with better access to official modding tools.\n\nWhilst there are many things that I like about this game, and more that aren't listed here, there is one glaring issue...\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] The Big Issue [/h1]\n\nTrying not to get into too many details, I do really like the story of this game. It has the right amount of witty dialogue, scary settings, and feels. But, I feel like this game focuses too much on the main story, and too little on the other concepts of the universe. One of the first examples that comes to mind is [spoiler]right after Jackie's death, when Dexter shoots V in the head, and you suddenly wake up as Johnny Silverhand, on a mission to invade Arasaka, getting killed by Adam Smasher in the process.[/spoiler] After this segment, we can see Johnny being interrogated by a few big names in the game, all occurring in an unknown room. What was that place? Was it some sort of afterlife? Do only people who are reserved as legends end up there? What even happened in between the player arriving in this space, and Johnny waking up in V's body? It's things like these that make me think about all the deeper parts of the game, and more so, how very little they're talked about. There are many more examples of this, especially in the context of cyberpsychos and how cyberpsychosis even works. These are not explained in the game, which could lead to new players who aren't familiar with the lore of the game being very confused. I know I was confused for a long time. This leads to the game not portraying the main issues of Night City very well.\n\nWhilst this is a big issue for me, there is some hope...\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] A Silver(hand) Lining [/h1]\n\nCDPR have already said that they are committed to the Cyberpunk franchise, and will continue to build the story, whether that will be through updates, expansions, or straight-up sequels is still up in the air... well, except for the fact that there will be a full expansion for CP2077 coming out next year...\n\nBut, that's not the point. What I'm trying to say is that I hope that with the expansion, and whatever comes after, that the concepts of this game and the universe of Cyberpunk in general can be explained more thoroughly.\n\nBut thankfully, there is a way to get deeper into the story of Night City.\n\nAs of the writing of this review, there is a new original anime series titled [b]Cyberpunk: Edgerunners[/b] on Netflix, which explains some of the concepts of the universe, whilst also offering a great story to go along with it. I strongly urge anybody who wants to know more about the lore of Cyberpunk, or even anybody who wants more from Cyberpunk to watch the anime. as I believe it shows off both the best and worst parts of Night City better than the game could ever do.\n\n\n\n[spoiler]god damnit steam needs a better way to format reviews i spent a good 2 hours trying to format this whole goddamn thing and still probably got some things wrong, fml[/spoiler]\n\n[spoiler]also sorry if i got anything wrong or if i just seemed incompetent as hell, not too big on cyberpunk lore[/spoiler]",

Don't go into this game expecting a magnum opus of game development, it's only above average.\n\n[h1] the gunplay [/h1]\nFeels more like an RPG than a FPS; enemies above your level take [i]several[/i] headshots to kill on harder difficulties, and enemies generally just feel like bullet sponges. There are really only about two dozen weapons in the game with various stats applied, and you encounter the same weapons over and over again. The only variety you can find is in the weapons from quests and legendary loot. Picking up some random guy's weapon just gives you the same 3 weapons over and over again.\n\n[h1] the progression [/h1]\nSince it prioritizes RPG elements over anything else, the progression in this game is actually very fun. Unfortunately, it's VERY easy to \"optimize the fun out of the game.\"\n\nWhat do I mean by that? It means that it's possible to grind out levels on generic missions for long enough that you end up so powerful that you can kill enemies with little to no effort and breeze through the main story. You end up playing the boring missions to progress to the point that the good missions become a breeze.\n\n[h1] story [/h1]\nstory's good, but the \"branching paths\" like what was advertised just aren't there. While some missions have different paths to take (aka the good ones), the others have Fallout 4's system, where your options ultimately boil down to\n\nA.) yes\nB.) sarcastic yes\nC.) yes (correct path that gives you items)\nD-F.) give me information\n\nThe three paths you can choose at the start of the game change nothing but the prologue missions. They give you one extra response here and there, but overall you can experience pretty much the same exact game no matter what path you choose. No matter what you do, you're always \"mercenary V who has the ghost of keanu reeves in their head.\"\n\n[h1] graphics [/h1]\nThe game looks beautiful. Better than quite a few other open world games. A big problem is that the animations for V are dogshit and need to be reworked. There is no third person mode, but you can still see V's shadow and watching your shadow while you do certain animations like swim is VERY immersion breaking. Pre-baked animations make everything feel wrong, if you've ever played the original half-life that's about how it feels. At least this game has ragdolls.\n\nThe low amount of enterable buildings while exploring the open world is annoying, and it makes the world feel as deep as a puddle. The city, while it uses very few copy and pasted buildings, ends up feeling very same-y. There's a large amount of sex shops, which does fit with the aesthetic of the game, but as dunkey put it, it would've been cool to see something more interesting than a store called peepee, like a stadium or a zoo.\n\nThe lack of a proper physics engine is to this game's detriment. While NPCs can ragdoll, there are several pre-baked animations that play that can hurt immersion after seeing them so many times (like the animation that always plays when you get run over by a car).\n\nThe game's AI is horrible, you can literally watch as most of the AI you come across just walks in circles. I'm not asking for reactive AI, but something better than every single AI playing a second-long loop of a fear animation when you point a gun at them while the rest of the city ignores you would be a good start.\n\nPlaying this game feels like there's this illusion of a living city, but the moment that you apply pressure or investigate further, the illusion breaks. \n\nNPCs driving you around is a nice touch as opposed always driving myself, and it creates new story opportunities, but it would be nicer if I had something like a zoom camera to look around at the city with or something like V checking their neural implants and customizing themselves in the car, like having your inventory accessible while the car is still running and moving around.\n\n[h2] closing notes: [/h2]\nI hate how this game folds under any pressure you apply to it. The open world is barely immersive at all. The updates definitely improve the game by a lot, but some more immersion features would be nicer.\n\nI'm placing this positive review because they finally added transmog (the best update feature by far), and V no longer looks like a walking freak show. Also, download mods. I recommend \"annoy me no more\" (with reasonable police disabled), \"enhanced police,\" \"Shadow Hair\" (which makes V's shadow not be bald) and \"immersive first person.\" Redscript and Cyber Engine Tweaks are both required for script extensions.",

It still crashes occasionally, and there are a still a few minor bugs here and there, but it's actually pretty rare at this point. CDPR did release some recommendations as far as PC specs and graphical settings go, and following that guide really helped. This game is super heavy on both GPU and CPU, so if you're having issues and aren't running literally top of the line specs I'd recommend dropping your settings.\n\nOriginal:\nWatched the Netflix show, thought I'd give the game a try since it's getting better reviews and they've had 1.5 years since its release to fix the issues. The game has crashed at least 5x in the first 2 hours I've played the game, not to mention a few T-posing in the tutorial/training. Running a fairly high-end PC (including a 3080ti), drivers are up to date. Most freezes seemed to happen in the equipment menu.\n\nI really want to jump into this game, but to find it still this bad 1.5 years later is disheartening. I'm going to keep trying to play the game, but not keeping my hopes very high.",

The entire universe of the game is intriguing, the first-person perspective and the relationships with the NPCs help in an impressive immersion (sometimes I ignore my girlfriend on her cell phone to respond to Panam's messages). The city is impressive, the true protagonist of the story..\nUpdate 1.6 did a lot of good for the game, and the next one promises even more with vehicle combat and a police overhaul (finally!).\n\nOh yeah, it has a hell of a lot of minor bugs these days, the car physics is awful, and if I'm waiting for patches it means it's an unfinished game, under construction. It's not right with players after all those promises, but I wasn't hyped by Cyberpunk, I didn't expect anything from the game, and I waited for the updates. If you didn't feel cheated by CDprojekt, you'll definitely love Cyberpunk, because the game is really good. Anyone who felt cheated is totally right, and it's understandable if you don't want to give it a second chance.\n\n---\n\nUma obra de arte no quesito lore, roleplaying e ambienta\u00e7\u00e3o! Todo o universo do game \u00e9 intrigante, a perspectiva em primeira pessoa e os relacionamentos com os NPCs ajudam numa imers\u00e3o impressionante (as vezes eu ignoro minha namorada no celular para responder as mensagens da Panam). A cidade \u00e9 impressionante, o verdadeiro protagonista da hist\u00f3ria.\nA atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o 1.6 fez muito bem para o jogo, e a pr\u00f3xima promete ainda mais com combate em ve\u00edculos e reformula\u00e7\u00e3o da pol\u00edcia (finalmente!).\n\nAh sim, tem um inferno de bugs menores atualmente, a f\u00edsica dos carros \u00e9 horrorosa, e se eu estou esperando patchs significa que \u00e9 um jogo inacabado, em constru\u00e7\u00e3o. N\u00e3o \u00e9 certo com os jogadores depois daquelas promessas todas, mas EU n\u00e3o estava hypado por Cyberpunk, n\u00e3o esperava nada do jogo, e eu esperei as atualiza\u00e7\u00f5es. Se voc\u00ea n\u00e3o se sentiu enganado pela CDprojekt com certeza vai amar Cyberpunk, pois o jogo \u00e9 realmente muito bom. Quem se sentiu enganado est\u00e1 totalmente na raz\u00e3o, e da pra entender se n\u00e3o quiser dar uma segunda chance.",

[/b]\nThere is something in the streets of Night City. Something that if it ever reaches you it never go out. And that feeling is worth every minute spent in-game.\n\nI have explored a lot. Maxed out what I could and there is a point when you are almost invincible (this might have been fixed or leveled in the latest patches). \n\nIn conclusion, if you love exploring every nook and cranny, if you like simple gameplay and rich storytelling, you have to play it. \n\nI think anyone should take a walk in Night City at least once in their life!",

Hell no. Not anymore, not after patch 1.6\n\nSince the last update, I\u2019ve had suicidal cops jumping in front of my car. So my drive to the mission is interrupted by dodging the police. Cars randomly fall on my head in middle of a fire fight. Textures go from terrible, to crap, to terrible depending on where I view them from; was not like that before the patch. Certain enemies have become immortal, so I might have to decapitate them and await the quickening I think. To top it all off, I\u2019ve watched random accidents occur in slow motion or had pedestrians run away in fear simply because I walked out of a building. I've also come across plenty of people who just spawn in the middle of the road, waiting for me to Carmegeddon them for laughs.\n\n1.6 is like putting a plaster on a stab wound and calling it a day. Yes yes yes, I know, Witcher 4 is taking up most of the staff at CDPR, but the modding community had done a lot already to sort this mess out. Just chuck some credits their way and work with what they had created. I mean, they\u2019ve even reinstated the mass transit system and it looks amazing, from what I\u2019ve seen.\nIn essence the game has already been fixed, but those fixes are only available to the few who know how to implement them.\nIf you have not bought this game yet, then save your money. Spend it on Witcher 3 instead, that game is absolutely amazing. Ignore Cyberpunk.",

My last save was just before I took on the final main mission, the point of no return. So now I can play it again choosing the different approaches offered... Wonderful, more endings to explore.

The story is good, I finished the game and all side quests in 60h which i think is kinda short and it feels unfinished if you compare to other CDPR games. Night city's verticality is only an ilusion as you can't explore much the tall buildings. To me the game mechanics and different play styles are what made the game fun to me. \nDef worth it if its on sale!",

        "content": "As much as I like the Cyberpunk Aesthetic and running around as a G-58 Dian wielding Chinese Mercenary death-squading all the various gangs and rival corporations, the game inherently is lacking in role playing elements considering it claims to be an RPG. I think the lack of faction storylines really hurt the game considering you hardly actually interact with any group in Night City outside of shooting up their hideouts and offices (With the only exceptions being the Arasaka and Aldecados endings). The character backgrounds were also something that could have been greatly expanded on considering they usually just result in occasional bartering options for extra money. The game has come a long way from launch in terms of performance but remains quite buggy especially concerning audio triggers. I still enjoy Cyberpunk despite these flaws but the only time you should ever consider getting the game at this point if you are interested would be if its on sale at half off or more.\n\nIn summary 10/10  \n\u5eb7\u6dd8\u96c6\u56e2\u8d5e\u52a9",

I purchased on PS4 preordered and everything. I encountered a few blue screens but it didnt prevent me from trying to progress more. The PC version is much more stable and i recommend this game to anyone that wants to enjoy a single player story with a good length.",

But right now it's very enjoyable to play in the open-world doing side missions and gigs; it feels like it's all starting to come together. One of the first things that I did on this playthrough was I stole a Quadra and right away I zoned into it because it felt really good to drive - collisions, acceleration, braking/skidding - it's just pretty awesome to drive around this game in first person now. Some of the police AI working to some extent, very smooth frame rates and even some emergent dynamic stuff going on - while I was on a gig, I was shooting at some punks and the cops joined in, as one of the cops was running across the street a frightened driver floored his van and ran him over at a pretty high speed - it looked brutal. \n\nRockstar has been working on their RAGE engine for 20 years, so I can only see great things coming from CPR pulling themselves up by their bootstraps (up past their eyeballs) creating this engine and game. No other developer has tried something this ballsy and although CP2077 might not be the dark cyberpunk RPG I thought it was going to be, it is finally turning out to be a pretty good open world looter shooter romp with tons of high quality atmosphere and I hope we get to the point where they can drop meaningful expansions.",

        "content": "This game is hard call to make a choise do i like it or not. It is very good game but at the same time it is most irritating and frustrating game i've ever played. Let me try to explain. Game is made very well: story i good, graphics are very good and game is build very well meaning you really feel like you are in some sort of cyberpunk type world. Atmosphere is so good that i can allmost touch it: busy street's with all kinds of people from normal to freaks with cyber implants; echoing halls with lots of shadows and places to hide while you enemies voice is echoing in emptyness. Big open world with lots of things to do and places to explore.\nBut then the other side. First of all, this game needs some serious horsepower under the hood to run well. Update 1.6 made it run a bit worse which is a shame since game is allready very demanding. Hopefully this will be fixed soon. Second thing that makes me allmost break my keyboard is that when ever there is a story line mission for you to do, you can be sure that there is a _long_ cutscenes whic you are not able to skip. You can skip dialogues but not the videos. Yes cutscenes are made very well like everything else in this game but they are so long and detailed that it makes me seriously wounder were developers planning to make a movie or a game. And to make things worse,  you have to sit there and watch all cutscenes because time to time developers decided to drop a one single line of dialogue which you have to choose and in the end these choises dont make videos or end any different. So you cant leave game running and go watch tv. This is so super irritating that i have to fight hard not to give this a negative. Second thing is that these videos are very violent and you have no choise to skip any of them, like in one video you have to watch yourself been shot in the head twice. Third thing to complain is music: thru the whole game music is playing everywhere you go. Yes you can turn off music playing inside car and turn off copyrighted music but still there is all sorts of music playing in streets, music in alley, music in market places, everywhere. I love music but too much is too much and most of the time its just ruining the atmosphere.\n\nI'm giving it a recommendation because of the hard work making this game but with a notice about cutscenes and some serious violence, which you have no option to skip.

Yes, it's not the OPENWORLDNEXTGENEXPERIENCEOMG that was promised. But it is a REALLY fun RPG shooter looter slasher hackathon, like Deus Ex and Borderlands had a kid and just let them do what they wanted without hot housing them. \n\nHacking people in slow motion, blinding them, setting them on fire and then slicing them to pieces with a monofilament electrified arm whip and then gunning down the rest of them with flaming bullets never gets old. The driving is pleasantly suprisingly satisfying. Really recommend this if you're into the mood, they got the vibe down pat.",
